## The Honest Take

### Choose Span if:
- You're enterprise-scale (100+ devs)
- Deep code-level AI analysis matters
- Budget is pre-approved for enterprise tools
- SOC 2 compliance is required today
- You want detailed attribution models

### Choose Tformance if:
- You want transparent, published pricing
- Startup/mid-size team (10-150 devs)
- PR-level detection is sufficient
- Fast setup matters (5 min vs weeks)
- You prefer flat-rate over per-seat

## AI Detection: How We Compare

### Our Approach

**Tformance:** Detects AI tool usage from PR metadata and patterns. Looks for Copilot, Cursor, Claude signatures in commits and PR descriptions. No code scanning required.

**Span:** Analyzes code patterns to identify AI-generated content. More granular detection at the code block level.

### Trade-offs

| Aspect | Tformance | Span |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Granularity** | PR-level | Code-level |
| **Setup complexity** | OAuth only | Deeper integration |
| **Privacy** | Metadata only | Code analysis |
| **Speed** | Real-time | Batch analysis |

Neither is "better"—depends on your needs.

## Pricing Comparison

### The Math

Span doesn't publish pricing. Enterprise tools typically cost $50-100+/seat.

| Team Size | Span (estimated) | Tformance (annual) | Potential Savings |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 25 devs | $15,000-30,000+ | $3,588 (Team) | $11,000-26,000 |
| 50 devs | $30,000-60,000+ | $3,588 (Team) | $26,000-56,000 |
| 100 devs | $60,000-120,000+ | $8,388 (Business) | $51,000-111,000 |

## Where They're Ahead

Span has built deep AI detection capabilities:

- **Code-level analysis** — More granular than PR-level
- **Attribution models** — Which code blocks are AI-generated
- **Enterprise compliance** — SOC 2, enterprise security
- **Deeper integrations** — Jira, more Git providers

We're catching up. Different starting points.

## FAQ

### Which has better AI detection, Tformance or Span?

Different approaches. Span does code-level analysis. Tformance uses PR patterns. Span may be more granular; Tformance is simpler to deploy.

### Is Span expensive?

Enterprise pricing typically is. Span requires a demo for pricing. Tformance publishes prices: $99-699/mo flat rate.

### Can Tformance detect AI at the code level?

Not currently. We detect at PR/commit level via patterns. Good enough for adoption tracking; not for line-by-line attribution.

### Does Span analyze my actual code?

Yes, Span performs code analysis. Tformance only looks at metadata and patterns, not code content. Depends on your privacy preferences.

### Which tool is better for compliance reporting?

Span is SOC 2 certified with enterprise compliance. Tformance is SOC 2 in progress. For strict compliance needs today, Span is ahead.
