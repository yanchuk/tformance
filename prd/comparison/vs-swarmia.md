## Pricing Comparison

### The Math

Swarmia uses modular pricing: €22/dev/mo (base) + €20/dev/mo (insights). Tformance uses flat rates.

| Team Size | Swarmia (annual, full) | Tformance (annual) | You Save |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 10 devs | ~$5,544 | $1,188 (Starter) | $4,300+ |
| 25 devs | ~$13,860 | $3,588 (Team) | $10,200+ |
| 50 devs | ~$27,720 | $3,588 (Team) | $24,100+ |
| 100 devs | ~$55,440 | $8,388 (Business) | $47,000+ |

*Swarmia: €42/dev/mo full package × 12 months, converted at ~$1.10/€. Actual pricing varies.*

### Modular vs Flat

Swarmia's modular approach: pay for what you use.
Tformance's flat approach: one price, everything included.

Neither is wrong. Depends on your preference.

## FAQ

### Is Tformance a good Swarmia alternative?

If AI impact measurement is your priority, yes. If developer experience surveys and team health are primary, Swarmia is built for that.

### Does Swarmia detect AI tool usage?

Not specifically. Swarmia focuses on overall developer productivity, not AI coding tool impact.

### Why doesn't Tformance have surveys yet?

We're building AI impact first. Surveys are coming—with a twist (gamified "AI Detective" experience). Quality over speed.

### Can I use both tools?

Yes, though there's overlap in core metrics. Some teams use Tformance for AI impact and another tool for surveys. Depends on budget.

### Is Swarmia better for European teams?

Swarmia is based in Finland with Euro pricing. May be advantageous for EU compliance. Tformance is US-based with USD pricing.

### What's "working agreements" in Swarmia?

Team-defined rules (PR size limits, review turnaround) with automated tracking. Tformance doesn't have this—we focus on measurement, not process enforcement.
