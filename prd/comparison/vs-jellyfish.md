## FAQ

### Is Tformance a good Jellyfish alternative?

For smaller teams (10-150 devs) focused on AI impact, yes. For enterprise orgs needing R&D capitalization and deep Jira, Jellyfish is purpose-built.

### Why is Jellyfish so expensive?

Enterprise features, enterprise sales, enterprise support. If you need all that, it's worth it. If you don't, you're overpaying.

### Can a 200+ dev team use Tformance?

Yes, at our Enterprise tier (custom pricing). But honestly, if you're 200+ devs with enterprise requirements, evaluate Jellyfish too. We're optimized for smaller, faster teams.

### Does Tformance do R&D capitalization?

No. That's not our focus. If CapEx/OpEx tracking is critical, Jellyfish or similar enterprise tools are better fits.

### How long does Jellyfish implementation take?

Typically weeks to months for enterprise deployments. Tformance: 5 minutes to first data.

### Is Tformance secure enough for enterprise?

We're SOC 2 in progress. For teams needing certification today, Jellyfish already has it.
