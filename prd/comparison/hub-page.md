### What We're Not (Yet)

- Full DORA suite (we have cycle time, more coming)
- Jira deep integration (shipping soon)
- SOC 2 certified (in process)
- Slack surveys (on the roadmap)

We ship weekly. Things change fast.

## FAQ Section (for SEO)

### Q: Which engineering analytics tool is best for small teams?

Tformance is built for teams of 10-150 engineers. Flat-rate pricing means no per-seat anxiety as you grow. Enterprise tools like Jellyfish target 200+ engineers.

### Q: What's the cheapest alternative to LinearB?

Tformance costs 70% less than LinearB for a 50-dev team (~$3,600/year vs ~$24,000/year). We focus on AI impact metrics rather than workflow automation.

### Q: Do I need Jira integration for engineering analytics?

Not necessarily. If your workflow centers on GitHub, you can get valuable insights without Jira. Tformance tracks PR metrics, cycle time, and AI tool adoption directly from GitHub.

### Q: What makes Tformance different from other analytics tools?

We focus specifically on AI coding tool impact—tracking adoption, correlating with delivery metrics, and showing ROI. Most competitors bolt AI features onto existing platforms.

### Q: Is Tformance ready for production use?

We're in alpha with real customers. Core features work. Some capabilities competitors have (Jira, Slack surveys) are coming soon. We're transparent about our roadmap.
