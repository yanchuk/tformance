# CTO Marketing Copy: Patterns That Convert Technical Buyers

## Purpose

Guide creation of marketing copy that resonates with CTOs and engineering leaders. Complements `writing-well` skill by adding audience-specific patterns, competitive positioning, and B2B SaaS messaging frameworks.

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activates when:
- Writing copy for landing pages targeting CTOs
- Creating comparison pages (us vs competitors)
- Developing pricing page messaging
- Writing homepage hero sections
- Crafting value propositions for technical buyers
- Creating differentiation messaging
- Working in `templates/web/compare/**` or `templates/web/pricing.html`

## Tformance Positioning

### Who We Are

**One-liner:** Engineering analytics that show what's actually happening

**Full positioning:** Tformance helps CTOs understand team performance and AI tool impact—with real data, not vanity metrics.

**The two things CTOs ask:**
1. "How is my team actually performing?" (cycle time, throughput, bottlenecks)
2. "Is AI making us faster?" (adoption, effectiveness, ROI)

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Title | CTO, VP Engineering, Engineering Director |
| Company size | 15-75 developers (sweet spot: 25-50) |
| Stage | Series A-D funded tech companies |
| Pain | "I need real metrics, not story points" + "Board asks about AI ROI" |
| Urgency | Need visibility into team performance and AI adoption |
| Budget holder | Yes |

### Who We're NOT For

- Enterprise companies with 500+ engineers (they need Jellyfish)
- Teams needing complex workflow automation (they need LinearB)
- Companies requiring SOC 2 Type II, on-prem, or custom SLAs

### Our Differentiators

1. **Built for smaller teams** - Not a watered-down enterprise tool; built ground-up for 15-75 developer teams
2. **Team performance + AI impact** - Both sides of the story, not just one
3. **Tiered flat pricing** - $99/$299/$699 by team size, not per-seat (70-80% cheaper than competitors)
4. **Self-serve** - No demo calls, no sales process, start in 5 minutes
5. **Honest comparison** - Acknowledge where competitors are ahead

## The Four CTO Questions

Every CTO evaluating Tformance asks these questions. Your copy should address them.

### Question 1: "How is my team actually performing?"

**The pain:**
- Story points are meaningless
- Velocity feels like a vanity metric
- Can't tell if PRs are slow or reviews are slow
- Board wants numbers, not feelings

**Copy patterns:**
```
# Direct address
"Understand your team's velocity."

# Problem statement
"Story points don't tell you what's actually happening."

# Data framing
"See cycle time, throughput, and where work gets stuck."
```

### Question 2: "Is AI actually making us faster?"

**The pain:**
- Board asks about AI ROI, CTO can't answer
- Anecdotes aren't data
- Some devs swear by Copilot, others ignore it

**Copy patterns:**
```
# Direct address
"See if AI tools help."

# Problem statement
"You bought Copilot licenses for everyone. Are they using them?"

# Data framing
"See exactly which AI tools your team uses—and whether they're helping."
```

### Question 3: "How do we compare to other teams?"

**The pain:**
- No benchmark for "good" performance or AI adoption
- Peer comparison anxiety
- Don't know if ahead or behind

**Copy patterns:**
```
# Benchmark promise
"See how your team compares to similar engineering orgs."

# Gap identification
"Find out where you're ahead—and where you're behind."

# Competitive framing
"Know where you stand before the board asks."
```

### Question 4: "What should we actually do?"

**The pain:**
- Data without action is useless
- Need specific recommendations
- Drowning in dashboards, starving for insights

**Copy patterns:**
```
# Action-oriented
"Get specific recommendations, not just more dashboards."

# Insight framing
"We tell you what to fix, not just what's broken."

# Next step clarity
"See what's slowing you down and how to fix it."
```

## Copy Principles

### 1. Numbers Beat Adjectives

CTOs trust data. Replace vague claims with specific numbers.

```
# Vague (bad)
"Industry-leading analytics for engineering teams"

# Specific (good)
"See your cycle time, AI adoption rate, and PR throughput"
```

**Even without stats, be specific:**
```
# Vague
"Fast setup"

# Specific
"Connect in 2 minutes. See data in 5."
```

### 2. Acknowledge Complexity

CTOs know their world is complex. Copy that oversimplifies loses credibility.

```
# Oversimplified (loses trust)
"AI tools will 10x your team's productivity!"

# Acknowledges reality (builds trust)
"AI tools help—when used right. We show you which ones work for your team."
```

### 3. Honesty as Differentiator

Most B2B copy hides weaknesses. Honesty stands out and builds trust.

**Pattern: "Where they're ahead (for now)"**
```
# On comparison pages
"LinearB has better CI/CD pipeline analytics. We're focused on AI impact first."

# On feature gaps
"We don't have Slack surveys yet. Coming Q2."
```

### 4. Problem Before Solution

State the pain before offering relief. CTOs need to feel understood.

```
# Solution-first (weak)
"Tformance provides comprehensive AI analytics."

# Problem-first (strong)
"Your board asks about AI ROI. You can't answer. Tformance fixes that."
```

### 5. Contrast Framing

Position us against alternatives to sharpen differentiation.

```
# Simple contrast
"Real metrics, not vanity dashboards"

# Competitor contrast
"$99-699/mo tiered. Not $30/seat/month."

# Behavior contrast
"See actual AI usage, not self-reported surveys"
```

## Social Proof for Early Stage

We're early. Here's how to build credibility without customers:

### Authority Patterns
```
# Methodology credibility
"Built on DORA and SPACE research"

# Data credibility
"Analyzing 1M+ commits to understand AI impact"

# Founder credibility
"Built by engineers who lived this problem"
```

### Early Adopter Patterns
```
# Beta framing
"Join 50+ teams in early access"

# Waitlist urgency
"We're onboarding 10 teams per week"

# Founding customer offer
"Founding members get 50% off forever"
```

### What to Avoid
- Fake testimonials
- Inflated numbers
- "Trusted by thousands" (when we have dozens)

## CTA Hierarchy

### Primary CTA (High Commitment)
- **"Start Free Trial"** - Clear, no friction
- **"Start Free"** - Even shorter, modern

### Secondary CTA (Low Commitment)
- **"See How It Works"** - For the curious
- **"Compare All Tools"** - On comparison pages
- **"View Pricing"** - When price is the question

### Dual CTA Pattern
Place both on key pages:
```html
<button class="btn-primary">Start Free</button>
<button class="btn-secondary">See How It Works</button>
```

### CTA Placement Rules
- After pain point section → "See How We Help"
- After features → "Start Free Trial"
- After pricing → "Start Free"
- After comparison → "Try It Free"
