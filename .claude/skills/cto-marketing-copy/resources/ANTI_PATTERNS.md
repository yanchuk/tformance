# Anti-Patterns in B2B SaaS Copy

Common mistakes to avoid when writing CTO-focused marketing copy.

---

## 1. Buzzword Bingo

### The Problem
Empty jargon signals lack of substance. CTOs have seen it all.

### Examples to Avoid
```
❌ "AI-powered insights for next-generation productivity"
❌ "Leverage cutting-edge technology to optimize workflows"
❌ "Best-in-class solution for engineering excellence"
❌ "Revolutionary platform that transforms how teams work"
❌ "Synergize cross-functional alignment through data-driven insights"
```

### Instead
```
✓ "See which AI tools your team actually uses"
✓ "Find out what's slowing down your PRs"
✓ "Know if Copilot is helping before the board asks"
```

### Banned Words/Phrases
| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| Best-in-class | Be specific about what's good |
| World-class | Describe the actual capability |
| Revolutionary | Explain what it changes |
| Cutting-edge | Describe the technology |
| Synergy | Just say "work together" |
| Leverage | Use |
| Optimize | Improve, fix, speed up |
| Holistic | Complete, full |
| Scalable | Works for teams of X-Y |

## 2. Feature Dumping

### The Problem
Listing features without benefits is lazy and boring.

### Example to Avoid
```
❌ Features:
   - Real-time sync
   - Dashboard analytics
   - Team management
   - API access
   - Custom reports
   - Slack integration
```

### Instead
```
✓ What you get:
   - See changes as they happen (real-time sync)
   - Spot problems before they ship (dashboard)
   - Know who needs help (team view)
```

### The Rule
Every feature needs a "so you can..." or "which means..."

---

## 3. Empty Superlatives

### The Problem
Vague praise is meaningless. Anyone can claim it.

### Examples to Avoid
```
❌ "Industry-leading analytics"
❌ "Unparalleled visibility"
❌ "Exceptional performance"
❌ "Seamless integration"
❌ "Robust platform"
```

### Instead
```
✓ "See data from 1M+ commits" (specific)
✓ "Connects to GitHub in 2 minutes" (measurable)
✓ "Tracks 12 AI coding tools" (concrete)
```

### The Test
If your competitor could say the same thing, it's not differentiation.

---

## 4. FOMO Manipulation

### The Problem
Fear-based copy erodes trust and attracts the wrong customers.

### Examples to Avoid
```
❌ "Don't get left behind in the AI revolution!"
❌ "Your competitors are already using this"
❌ "Limited time offer - act now!"
❌ "Only 5 spots left!"
❌ "You can't afford to miss this"
```

### Instead
```
✓ "See how your AI adoption compares" (data, not fear)
✓ "Most teams start seeing insights in 5 minutes" (value)
✓ "Try free for 14 days" (low-pressure)
```

### The Rule
Appeal to opportunity, not fear. CTOs respond to value, not panic.

---

## 5. False Exclusivity

### The Problem
Artificial scarcity insults intelligence.

### Examples to Avoid
```
❌ "Exclusive platform for elite engineering teams"
❌ "By invitation only"
❌ "Not for everyone"
❌ "For serious teams only"
```

### Instead
```
✓ "Built for teams of 20-200 engineers"
✓ "Self-serve signup. No demo calls."
✓ "Start free today"
```

### The Rule
If it's a SaaS product, it's available. Don't pretend otherwise.

---

## 6. Hiding Limitations

### The Problem
CTOs will discover gaps. Better they learn from you first.

### Examples to Avoid
```
❌ Avoiding mention of missing features
❌ Saying "coming soon" for features with no timeline
❌ Hiding pricing until demo call
❌ Burying limitations in fine print
```

### Instead
```
✓ "We don't have Slack surveys yet. Coming Q2."
✓ "LinearB has better workflow automation. We focus on AI impact."
✓ "$499/month. That's it. No hidden fees."
```

### The Rule
Honesty about limitations builds more trust than hiding them.

---

## 7. Generic Value Props

### The Problem
If any competitor could say it, it's not a value proposition.

### Examples to Avoid
```
❌ "We help engineering teams work better"
❌ "Improve your team's productivity"
❌ "Data-driven insights for better decisions"
❌ "The platform that understands developers"
```

### Instead
```
✓ "See exactly how AI tools affect your team's code"
✓ "Know if Copilot is worth the investment"
✓ "$499 flat rate, not $30/seat"
```

### The Test
Replace your company name with a competitor's. If it still works, it's too generic.

---

## 8. Passive Voice Overuse

### The Problem
Passive voice saps energy and creates distance.

### Examples to Avoid
```
❌ "Insights are provided by our platform"
❌ "Your data is analyzed automatically"
❌ "Reports are generated weekly"
```

### Instead
```
✓ "We show you insights"
✓ "We analyze your data automatically"
✓ "Get weekly reports"
```

---

## 9. Assuming Knowledge

### The Problem
Not every CTO knows your acronyms or methodology.

### Examples to Avoid
```
❌ "Improve your DORA metrics with SPACE-aligned insights"
❌ "Leveraging LLM-based analysis for DevEx optimization"
```

### Instead
```
✓ "Improve deployment frequency and lead time" (explain DORA)
✓ "We use AI to analyze your code patterns" (demystify)
```

### The Rule
Explain once, then abbreviate.

---

## 10. Overpromising

### The Problem
Claims you can't prove invite skepticism.

### Examples to Avoid
```
❌ "10x your team's productivity"
❌ "Guaranteed ROI"
❌ "Never miss a deadline again"
❌ "Solve all your engineering problems"
```

### Instead
```
✓ "Teams typically see insights within the first week"
✓ "Track the metrics that matter to your board"
✓ "Identify bottlenecks before they become blockers"
```

### The Rule
Promise what you can deliver. Exceed expectations in product, not copy.
