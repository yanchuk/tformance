# Headline Patterns

Proven headline formulas for CTO-focused marketing copy.

---

## 1. Question Headlines

Lead with the question CTOs are already asking.

### Pattern
`[Question CTO is asking]?`

### Examples
```
"How much of that code was written by AI?"
"Is Copilot actually making your team faster?"
"Are your AI tools helping or just adding noise?"
"Do you know which AI tools your team actually uses?"
"Where is AI-generated code getting stuck?"
```

### When to Use
- Homepage hero (creates immediate resonance)
- Blog post titles (encourages click-through)
- Email subject lines (sparks curiosity)

### Why It Works
CTOs are already asking these questions internally. Seeing it written validates their concern and positions us as having the answer.

---

## 2. Number Headlines

Specific numbers create credibility and curiosity.

### Pattern
`[Specific number] [outcome or insight]`

### Examples
```
"40% of your code is AI-generated. Is it slowing you down?"
"Teams track AI impact in under 5 minutes"
"See data from 1M+ commits on AI effectiveness"
"3 metrics that actually show AI impact"
"$499/month. Unlimited seats."
```

### When to Use
- Feature sections (specificity builds trust)
- Stats callouts (social proof)
- Pricing headers (transparency)

### Why It Works
Numbers are concrete. They can't be faked. CTOs distrust vague claims but trust specific data.

---

## 3. Contrast Headlines

Show what we are by showing what we're not.

### Pattern
`[What you want], not [what you don't want]`

### Variations
- `[Good thing] without [bad thing]`
- `[This], not [that]`
- `Finally: [solution] instead of [problem]`

### Examples
```
"Insights, not just dashboards"
"Real metrics, not vanity numbers"
"Action items, not more data to interpret"
"Flat-rate pricing, not per-seat games"
"AI impact data without the enterprise sales call"
```

### When to Use
- Differentiation sections
- Feature descriptions
- CTA area context

### Why It Works
Contrast sharpens meaning. CTOs know what they don't want. Showing we're the opposite builds trust.

---

## 4. Problem-Solution Headlines

State the pain, then offer relief—in one line.

### Pattern
`[Problem statement]. [Solution statement].`

### Examples
```
"Boards ask about AI ROI. Now you can answer."
"Your PR queue is growing. We show you why."
"AI writes code fast. Reviews can't keep up. We fix that."
"You have 50 Copilot licenses. No idea who uses them."
```

### When to Use
- Homepage secondary sections
- Pain point callouts
- Comparison page headers

### Why It Works
Demonstrates understanding of their world before offering a solution. Builds empathy-based trust.

---

## 5. Era/Age Headlines

Position the product as timely and relevant.

### Pattern
`[Category] for the [era/age/moment]`

### Examples
```
"Engineering analytics for the AI era"
"Developer metrics that actually matter in 2024"
"The productivity platform for AI-assisted teams"
"Built for how teams work now, not how they worked before"
```

### When to Use
- Company positioning statements
- About page headers
- Tagline variations

### Why It Works
Implies freshness and relevance. Positions legacy tools as outdated by contrast.

---

## 6. How/What/Why Headlines

Direct, explanatory framing for educational content.

### Pattern
- `How [audience] [achieves outcome]`
- `What [happens when / you need to know about]`
- `Why [something is true/important]`

### Examples
```
"How top engineering teams measure AI impact"
"What your board actually wants to know about AI ROI"
"Why traditional metrics fail in AI-assisted development"
"How to know if Copilot is worth the investment"
```

### When to Use
- Blog posts and guides
- How it works sections
- Educational content

### Why It Works
Promise of insight or education. CTOs are information-hungry and value learning.

---

## 7. Imperative Headlines

Direct command that prompts action.

### Pattern
`[Action verb] [specific outcome]`

### Examples
```
"See your AI impact in 5 minutes"
"Connect GitHub. Get insights."
"Stop guessing. Start measuring."
"Know what's slowing your team down"
```

### When to Use
- CTA sections
- Feature callouts
- Quick wins messaging

### Why It Works
Creates urgency and clarity. Tells reader exactly what they'll do and get.

---

## Headline Writing Rules

### 1. Lead with the Most Important Word
```
# Weak
"Our comprehensive analytics show AI impact"

# Strong
"AI impact analytics that actually tell you something"
```

### 2. Keep Under 10 Words (Ideally 6-8)
```
# Too long
"See exactly how much of your code was written by AI tools"

# Better
"See how much code AI wrote"
```

### 3. Avoid Jargon, Use Plain English
```
# Jargon
"Leverage ML-powered insights for engineering optimization"

# Plain
"See what's slowing your team down"
```

### 4. Test with "So What?"
After writing, ask "so what?" If the answer isn't obvious, rewrite.

```
# Fails "so what" test
"Comprehensive engineering analytics"

# Passes
"Know if AI is helping before the board asks"
```
