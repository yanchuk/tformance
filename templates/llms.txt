# Tformance

> Engineering analytics platform that measures AI coding tool impact on team performance.

Tformance is a SaaS platform for CTOs and engineering leaders to understand if AI coding tools (like GitHub Copilot) are actually improving their team's performance. We connect to GitHub and provide dashboards comparing AI-assisted work vs traditional development.

Free during Alpha. Target audience: CTOs and VP Engineering at companies with 10-50 developers evaluating GitHub Copilot ROI.

Privacy-first: We never access source code - only PR metadata (titles, timestamps, file paths).
