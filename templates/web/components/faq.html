            You shouldn't—yet. That's why it's free. I'm not asking for trust, I'm asking for a chance to earn it.
            I know there are YC-backed competitors with bigger teams. What I offer: direct access to me,
            faster iteration on YOUR feedback, and zero corporate overhead slowing things down.
            If I can't prove value in 30 days, you've lost nothing but 5 minutes of setup.

            I coded in school and uni, but I'm not a senior engineer—I'm a Technical Product Manager.
            I understand how complex systems work. I know the pains of developers and engineering managers because I've worked with them for 8 years.
            I'm building this with <span class="text-slate-200">Claude Code</span> (AI pair programming), and I'll hire senior engineers as we grow.
            Right now, I'm looking for a technical co-founder who shares this vision.

            Our infrastructure is SOC 2 certified (Render). Our own SOC 2 certification is planned for 2025—it's a priority,
            but certifications cost money I'd rather spend building features first.
            In the meantime: we don't touch your code, all data is encrypted, and senior Django devs review our security.
            I want to get SOC 2 as early as I can afford it.

            I'm bootstrapping with my savings. No VC runway to burn through. The goal is paid customers and profitability—not
            "growth at all costs" then shutdown. I want to build something sustainable.
            If you become a paying customer, you're directly funding development and keeping the lights on.
            That alignment means I'm incentivized to keep YOU happy, not investors.

            Because I'll listen. Big companies have roadmaps set 12 months out. I build what you tell me you need—this week.
            Your feedback literally becomes my roadmap. If you want to shape a tool instead of just using one,
            this is your chance. Early adopters get a direct line to the founder and influence over where this goes.

            Honest feedback. Try it, tell me what sucks, tell me what's missing.
            If it helps you—tell your CTO friends. Eventually, I hope you'll see enough value to include us in your company budget.
            Think of it as supporting someone trying to solve a real problem and save you time and stress.
            But zero pressure until YOU decide it's worth it.
