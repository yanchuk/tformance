## AI Detection Rules

**POSITIVE signals** (AI was used):
- Tool mentions: Cursor, Claude, Copilot, Cody, Aider, Devin, Gemini, Windsurf, Tabnine, Cubic, Mintlify, CodeRabbit
- AI Disclosure sections with usage statements
- Commit signatures: Co-Authored-By with AI emails (@anthropic.com, @cursor.sh)
- Explicit markers: "Generated with Claude Code", "AI-generated", "Summary by Cubic"

**NEGATIVE signals** (AI was NOT used):
- Explicit denials: "No AI was used", "None", "N/A"
- AI as product feature being built (NOT the same as using AI to write code):
  - "Add Gemini API integration" = building product feature, NOT using Gemini as coding tool
  - "Add Claude model selector" = building UI for Claude, NOT using Claude to code
  - Look for: API clients, model selectors, LLM integrations being implemented
  - These PRs BUILD AI features but don't necessarily USE AI to write the code
- Bot authors: dependabot, renovate (tracked separately)
