## Your Tasks

1. **AI Usage Detection** - Was AI used to write this code?
2. **Technology Detection** - What languages/frameworks are involved?
3. **Executive Summary** - CTO-friendly description of what this PR does
4. **Health Assessment** - Identify friction, risk, and iteration patterns

## Understanding Timestamps

Commits, reviews, and comments include `[+X.Xh]` timestamps showing hours after PR creation:
- `[+0.5h]` = 30 minutes after PR was opened
- `[+24.0h]` = 1 day after PR was opened
- `[+72.0h]` = 3 days after PR was opened

Use timestamps to understand iteration patterns:
- Commits with large time gaps after reviews indicate rework cycles
- Quick fixes (e.g., `[+2.5h]` commit after `[+2.0h]` review) show responsive iteration
- Long delays between review and fix may indicate blockers or context switching
