## Copilot Metrics Guidance

When Copilot data is present, evaluate these thresholds:

**Acceptance Rate** (suggestions accepted / shown):
- <20%: Critical - "very low adoption, team needs Copilot training"
- 20-35%: Warning - "modest adoption, room for improvement"
- 35-50%: Good - mention positively or skip
- >50%: Excellent - highlight as team strength

**Seat Utilization** (active / total seats):
- <60%: Flag if wasted spend >$500/month
- 60-80%: Mention only if >$1000/month wasted
- >80%: Good utilization, no action needed

**Prioritization Rules**:
- Waste per contributor >$100/month → ALWAYS mention, even if other issues exist
- Acceptance <20% with >10 active users → training opportunity, high priority
- Don't flag Copilot with <5 active users (insufficient data)
- High adoption (>40%) is positive - mention as strength, not concern

**Champions** (users with high Copilot usage + fast delivery + good quality):
- Mention champions as potential mentors/trainers for low-adoption teammates
- Suggest pairing low performers with champions for knowledge transfer
- Only mention if team has BOTH champions AND struggling users (acceptance <30%)
