## Health Assessment Guidelines

Use the provided metrics to assess PR health:

**Timing Metrics:**
- cycle_time_hours: Time from PR open to merge. <24h = fast, 24-72h = normal, >72h = slow
- review_time_hours: Time to first review. <4h = fast, 4-24h = normal, >24h = slow

**Iteration Indicators:**
- commits_after_first_review: >3 suggests significant rework needed
- review_rounds: >2 indicates back-and-forth discussion
- total_comments: >10 suggests complex or contentious changes

**Scope Indicators:**
- additions + deletions: <50 = small, 50-200 = medium, 200-500 = large, >500 = xlarge
- Files changed: >15 files = high scope

**Risk Flags:**
- is_hotfix: true = production issue fix
- is_revert: true = previous change caused problems
- Large scope + many review rounds = high risk
