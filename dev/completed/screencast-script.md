## PART 1: Dashboard Opening (~30 seconds)

**[Start on Dashboard, 30d selected]**

Let me show you what engineering leaders actually need to see.

This is Tformance—a dashboard that answers two questions every CTO gets asked: *How is my team performing?* and *Is AI actually helping us?*

Right away, you see the numbers that matter: 96 PRs merged, 36-hour cycle time, 49% AI adoption, and 12-hour review time. Each card shows a 12-week trend so you can spot patterns, not just snapshots.

**[Point to Engineering Insights]**

This AI-generated insight caught something interesting: AI-assisted PRs are taking longer than non-AI work. The system tells you *why* this might be happening—and gives a specific recommendation: ask a particular contributor to share their authoring load.

**[Hover over action buttons]**

See these action buttons? They're not just links—they're answers to 'okay, now what?' Let me show you.

---

## PART 2: Pull Requests (~30 seconds)

**[Click "Show AI-assisted PRs" button]**

One click and I'm looking at all AI-assisted pull requests. No filtering through menus.

Notice the advanced filters here—I can filter by AI tool, PR size, author, even review friction. This isn't a generic PR list. It's built for understanding how AI tools affect your workflow.

**[Expand one PR row]**

Click any PR and you see the full story: who wrote it, who reviewed it, how long each step took, which AI tool was detected, and whether it's linked to a Jira ticket. Real context, not just metadata.

**[Navigate back, click "Contributor workload"]**

Let me show you the team view...

---

## PART 3: Contributor Workload (~20 seconds)

**[Screen: Team/Contributor page]**

Here's where you see individual performance—not to micromanage, but to spot bottlenecks. Who's doing all the reviews? Who might need help?

This table shows authored PRs, reviews given, and AI adoption per contributor. When someone's carrying too much load, it shows up here before it shows up in burnout.

---

## PART 4: Analytics Tour (~40 seconds)

**[Navigate to Analytics > Overview]**

The Analytics section is where you go deeper. Five tabs, each answering a different question.

The **Overview** shows team health at a glance—AI adoption trending week by week, cycle time patterns, quality comparison between AI and non-AI work.

**[Click AI Adoption tab]**

**AI Adoption** breaks down which tools your team actually uses—Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude—and shows you who your power users are. If you're paying for Copilot licenses, you'll know exactly who's using them.

**[Click Delivery tab]**

**Delivery** tracks what matters: cycle time trends, PR sizes, and file categories. Smaller PRs merge faster. This chart shows you if your team is trending in the right direction.

**[Click Quality tab]**

**Quality** shows review time, revert rates, and code review distribution. That 4.2% revert rate from the dashboard? Here's the breakdown.

**[Click Trends tab]**

**Trends** gives you the long view—compare this quarter to last year, see performance by language or PR type, and benchmark against industry standards.

---

## PART 5: Integrations (~10 seconds)

**[Navigate to Integrations]**

Setup takes five minutes. Connect GitHub, optionally add Jira for ticket linking, and Slack for team surveys. No complex configuration—just authorize and sync.

---

## PART 6: Closing (~15 seconds)

**[Return to Dashboard]**

That's Tformance. Real metrics for engineering teams—not vanity dashboards.

Your board asks about AI ROI. Now you can answer.
