## Competitor Analysis

### What Works (from Linear, Railway, Notion, Axiom, Raycast):

| Site | Headline Style | Key Pattern |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Linear** | "purpose-built tool for X" | States what it IS directly |
| **Railway** | "Ship Software Peacefully" | Emotional benefit (removes burden) |
| **Notion** | "Zero busywork" | Addresses pain point directly |
| **Raycast** | "Your shortcut to everything" | Benefit in 4 words |
| **Axiom** | "Observability re-invented" | Category + differentiation |

### Common Patterns:
1. **Super short headlines** (3-7 words)
2. **Benefit-first** language
3. **Action CTAs** ("Start building", "Deploy now", "Get free")
4. **Social proof** (logos, numbers)
5. **No fluff** - every word earns its place

## Current tformance Issues

### What's Working:
- Hero headline is provocative and good
- Terminal animation is unique
- Problem stats are compelling

### What Needs Fixing:

| Issue | Current | Problem |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Weak CTA** | "Join Waitlist" | Sounds like vaporware |
| **Missing human element** | Generic startup speak | No personality, no "us" |
| **Too wordy** | Long paragraphs | Devs scan, don't read |
| **No partnership message** | Just features | CTOs want to be heard |
| **Emotional disconnect** | Problem stated | Solution feels cold |

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Hero Section

**Current headline**: ✅ Keep - it's good
> "Is AI making your team faster—or just busier?"

**New subheadline** (shorter, punchier):
```
Current: "Connect GitHub, Jira, and Slack to see if AI coding
         tools are actually improving delivery—or just creating
         more code to review."

New:     "Finally know if AI tools are helping—or just creating
         more code to review."
```

**New CTA**:
```
Current: "Join Waitlist"
New:     "Start Free" or "Try Free"
```

**New trust indicators**:
```
Current: "Free during beta" / "No credit card" / "Setup in 10 min"
New:     "Free until it works for you" / "No credit card" / "10 min setup"
```

### 2. NEW Section: "Built With You" (after problem)

Add a short section that communicates:
- We're bootstrapped (not VC-funded growth machine)
- We build with users, not for them
- Free until YOU see value
- Your feedback shapes the product

**Proposed copy**:
```
## Built With You, Not For You

We're a small team who got tired of guessing if AI tools help.

→ Bootstrapped. No VC pressure to ship fast and break things.
→ Free until it actually works for you. We mean it.
→ Your feedback = our roadmap. Talk to us anytime.

We're not building another dashboard you'll ignore.
We're building the tool we wished existed.
```

### 3. Problem Statement (simplify)

**Current**: Too much text explaining the paradox

**New**: Tighter, more punch
```
## The AI Productivity Paradox

+21% more code         +91% more review time
with AI tools          waiting in queue

More output. Same bottlenecks. No visibility.
The question: Is AI actually helping your team deliver?
```

### 4. Pricing Section

**Current**: "Free During Beta" + feature list

**New**: Emphasize partnership
```
## Free Until It Works

Not "free trial." Not "limited beta."
Free until YOU decide it's worth paying for.

We'd rather have 10 teams who love this
than 1000 who signed up and forgot.
```

### 5. Final CTA Section

**Current**: Generic "Join engineering teams..."

**New**: More direct, human
```
## Let's figure this out together.

We're building tformance because we had the same question you do.
Start free. Give us feedback. Help us make it actually useful.

[Start Free]

No credit card. Cancel anytime. Seriously.
```

## Content Principles

1. **Short > Long** - If it can be 5 words, don't use 15
2. **Direct > Clever** - Say what you mean
3. **Human > Corporate** - "We" and "You", not "Users" and "Platform"
4. **Honest > Hype** - "Free until it works" beats "Revolutionary AI analytics"
5. **Scannable** - Bullets, short paragraphs, clear hierarchy

---

## Implementation Order

1. Update hero subheadline + CTA
2. Add "Built With You" section after problem
3. Simplify problem statement
4. Update pricing messaging
5. Update final CTA
6. Review and adjust

---

## Not Changing

- Overall dark design (works well)
- Terminal animation (unique differentiator)
- Feature cards (good structure)
- Integration logos section
- How it works flow
