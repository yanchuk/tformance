## What to Look For in Each Section

**PR Description**: Primary source - explicit AI disclosure sections
**Commit Messages**: Secondary source - AI co-author signatures like "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
**Review Comments**: Context clues - reviewers asking "Did you use Cursor?" or "This looks AI-generated"
**Labels**: Quick signals - tags like "ai-generated", "ai-assisted", "cursor", "copilot"
**Files**: Pattern hints - many small files or typical AI refactoring patterns

## Detection Rules

### POSITIVE signals (AI was used to write/assist code):
1. **Tool mentions**: Cursor, Claude, Copilot, Cody, Aider, Devin, Gemini, Windsurf, Tabnine
2. **AI Disclosure sections**: Look for headings like "AI Disclosure", "AI Usage", "Tools Used"
   - Usage statements: "Used for", "Used to", "Helped with", "Assisted with"
   - Model names: Sonnet, Opus, Haiku, GPT-4, Claude 4.5
3. **Commit signatures**: Co-Authored-By with AI emails (@anthropic.com, @cursor.sh)
4. **Explicit markers**: "Generated with Claude Code", "AI-generated", "written by AI"
5. **IDE references**: "in Cursor", "via Cursor", "using Cursor IDE"

### NEGATIVE signals (AI was NOT used):
1. **Explicit denials**: "No AI was used", "None", "N/A", "Not used"
2. **AI as product feature** (building AI != using AI):
   - "Add AI to dashboard", "Integrate Claude API", "Gemini SDK support"
3. **Past references**: "Devin's previous PR", "as Claude mentioned" (referring to people/past work)
4. **Bot authors** (already tracked separately): dependabot, renovate

## Response Format

Return JSON:
```json
{
  "is_ai_assisted": boolean,
  "tools": ["lowercase", "tool", "names"],
  "usage_category": "authored" | "assisted" | "reviewed" | "brainstorm" | null,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "1-sentence explanation"
}
```

## Confidence Guidelines
- 0.9-1.0: Explicit "Generated with X" or clear AI disclosure
- 0.7-0.9: AI disclosure section with usage statement
- 0.5-0.7: Implicit or ambiguous usage
- 0.0-0.5: No AI used or explicit denial

## Tool Names (use lowercase)
cursor, claude, copilot, cody, devin, gemini, chatgpt, gpt4, aider, windsurf, tabnine, supermaven, codeium, continue
