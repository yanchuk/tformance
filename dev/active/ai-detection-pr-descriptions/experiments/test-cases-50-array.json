    "vars": {
      "pr_body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nThe `verify_and_fix_flags_cache_task` has been experiencing OOM kills. Investigation revealed that while the batch size reduction in #43961 was correct, memory can accumulate between batches because Python's GC doesn't aggressively release memory to the OS. Additionally, workers with high baseline memory from previous tasks have less headroom for this memory-intensive operation.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Add `gc.collect()` at the start of verification to clear accumulated garbage from previous tasks, maximizing available memory headroom\r\n- Add `gc.collect()` after each batch to prevent memory accumulation between batches\r\n- Remove unnecessary `select_related(\"team\")` from the flags batch loading query since only `team_id` is needed for grouping (Team objects are already loaded by the caller)\r\n\r\n## How did you test this code?\r\n\r\n- Ran all 126 affected unit tests:\r\n  - `posthog/storage/test/test_hypercache_verifier.py` (43 tests)\r\n  - `posthog/models/feature_flag/test/test_flags_cache.py` (75 tests)\r\n  - `posthog/tasks/test/test_hypercache_verification.py` (8 tests)\r\n- Verified with ruff that code passes linting and formatting checks\r\n\r\nThese are conservative changes that reduce memory pressure without changing verification behavior. Worker memory recycling configuration is being investigated separately as an infrastructure change.\r\n"

That PR aims to fix the same 500 error when using rewrites as proxies, but through a different approach.  \r\nThe issue still reproduced in this setup.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem by explicitly removing the `Accept-Encoding` header on proxied requests, preventing double compression when running behind a reverse proxy.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/87244#issuecomment-3679683910\r\n\r\n## Research and Findings\r\n\r\nDuring debugging, the following was observed:\r\n\r\n- The request consistently reaches the Next.js server and executes `proxyRequest`\r\n- The upstream responds successfully with status `200`\r\n- The response fully completes inside Next.js\r\n- When running behind Traefik with compression enabled, clients receive `500`\r\n- Removing `Accept-Encoding` or forcing `identity` resolves the issue\r\n\r\nThis strongly indicates a double compression or content encoding mismatch when multiple reverse proxies are involved.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Remove the `Accept-Encoding` header for proxied requests to prevent double compression\r\n- Keep proxy behavior otherwise unchanged\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\nFixes #87071\r\n"

When an admin impersonates another user and performs booking actions, the audit system now:\n- Records the **admin** as the actor (who actually performed the action)\n- Stores the **impersonated user's UUID** in a separate `context` field\n- Displays **\"Impersonated By\"** in the booking logs UI when viewing audit details\n\nThis separation ensures audit trail integrity (the admin is accountable) while preserving full context about whose account was being used.\n\n### Changes\n- Added `uuid` to `impersonatedBy` session object for actor identification\n- Added `uuid` to top-level `User` type in next-auth types for session enrichment\n- Added `context Json?` field to `BookingAudit` Prisma model\n- Added `BookingAuditContextSchema` for type-safe context handling with `actingAsUserUuid` field\n- Updated producer service interface and implementation to pass context through all queue methods\n- Updated consumer service to persist context to database\n- Updated repository to store and fetch context in BookingAudit records\n- Added `impersonatedBy` field to `EnrichedAuditLog` type in `BookingAuditViewerService`\n- Added `enrichImpersonationContext` method to resolve impersonated user details\n- Updated booking logs UI to display \"Impersonated By\" in expanded details\n- Added `impersonated_by` translation key\n\nLink to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/3f1252527aef4ead9401bdf055c0817b\nRequested by: hariom@cal.com (@hariombalhara)\n\n## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)\n\n- [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).\n- [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). N/A - internal infrastructure change\n- [ ] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.\n\n## How should this be tested?\n\n1. Verify type checks pass: `yarn type-check:ci --force`\n2. Verify existing audit tests still pass: `TZ=UTC yarn test`\n3. To fully test impersonation context display:\n   - Have an admin impersonate a user\n   - Perform a booking action (create, cancel, reschedule)\n   - Navigate to the booking's audit logs\n   - Expand the details for the action\n   - Verify \"Impersonated By\" row appears showing the impersonated user's name\n   - Verify the BookingAudit record has:\n     - `actorId` pointing to the admin's AuditActor\n     - `context` containing `{ actingAsUserUuid: \"<impersonated-user-uuid>\" }`\n\n## Human Review Checklist\n\n- [ ] Verify the `context` field schema design is appropriate for future extensibility\n- [ ] Confirm the `uuid` addition to User type in next-auth doesn't break existing auth flows\n- [ ] Check that the optional `context` parameter doesn't break existing queue method callers\n- [ ] Verify no migration file is needed (or if squashing is handled separately)\n- [ ] Verify the UI displays \"Impersonated By\" correctly when impersonation context is present\n- [ ] Confirm `enrichImpersonationContext` handles edge cases (null context, invalid context, deleted user)\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\n- [x] I have checked if my changes generate no new warnings"

Why use important tailwind override like `!w-5` ?**\r\nAns: The base `_icons.scss` has default width as **1em** for any icon. The current icon uses **width as 1em** from `%icon` from mentioned scss file and requires `!important` (current changes) or some custom css class for icon sizing which seems unnecessary for this case.\r\n\r\n## Desktop\r\n\r\n### Before (dark mode)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1392\" height=\"313\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dfb717f-ad52-4395-9c7f-38193f4c17dc\" />\r\n\r\n### Before (light mode)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1400\" height=\"303\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8aed4ce-d18f-46f0-8f5a-af3c50274aba\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### After (dark mode)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1401\" height=\"312\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89463511-6316-48ff-aafb-e44a867099b1\" />\r\n\r\n### After (light mode)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1397\" height=\"301\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8332497-9a34-4682-ba1e-729357a9b4e3\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Mobile\r\n\r\n### Before (dark mode)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"368\" height=\"698\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/900c3641-94b2-415e-a2ea-f4a4c6178309\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### Before (light mode)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"367\" height=\"693\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd0b8eaf-92a8-4b80-b9ae-cede2760ca30\" />\r\n\r\n### After (dark mode)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"369\" height=\"703\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ee73664-862b-49a5-8fb4-1d2fbc7dff90\" />\r\n\r\n### After (light mode)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"369\" height=\"698\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a76d20c-a839-4f6f-99c2-dba8aae1d53a\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAI Disclosure:\r\nNo AI used"
