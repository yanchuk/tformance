  - description: "[Cal.com] fix: compose CalendarCacheWrapper with CalendarBatchWrapper "
    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## What does this PR do?
        
        Previously, `CalendarCacheWrapper` and `CalendarBatchWrapper` were mutually exclusive - when cache was enabled, the batch wrapper was bypassed entirely. This caused uncached calendars to skip the batching logic, resulting in multiple freebusy API calls per `delegationCredential` instead of one consolidated call.
        
        This PR changes the wrapper composition so that:
        - If cache is enabled AND batch is supported: `CalendarCacheWrapper(CalendarBatchWrapper(originalCalendar))`
        - If cache is enabled but batch is not supported: `CalendarCacheWrapper(originalCalendar)`
        - If cache is not enabled but batch is supported: `CalendarBatchWrapper(originalCalendar)`
        - Otherwise: `originalCalendar`
        
        This ensures that when `CalendarCacheWrapper` passes uncached calendars to its underlying calendar, they are still properly batched by `delegationCredentialId` via `CalendarBatchWrapper`.
        
        ## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)
        
        - [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).
        - [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). N/A - internal implementation change only.
        - [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.
        
        ## How should this be tested?
        
        1. Enable both calendar cache and batch features for a Google Calendar credential with delegation
        2. Have some calendars with sync enabled (cached) and some without (uncached)
        3. Request availability for multiple calendars sharing the same `delegationCredentialId`
        4. Verify in logs that uncached calendars are batched together per `delegationCredentialId` instead of making separate freebusy calls
        
        **Expected behavior:** When both cache and batch are supported, the logs should show:
        - "Calendar Batch is supported, wrapping with CalendarBatchWrapper"
        - "Calendar Cache is enabled, wrapping with CalendarCacheWrapper" with `hasBatchWrapper: true`
        
        ## Checklist
        
        - [x] I have read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
        - [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project

        ---
        
        ### Human Review Checklist
        
        - [ ] Verify the wrapper composition order is correct (batch wrapper applied first, then cache wrapper on top)
        - [ ] Confirm that `CalendarCacheWrapper.getAvailability()` correctly forwards uncached calendars to its underlying calendar (now `CalendarBatchWrapper`)
        - [ ] Verify this change achieves the goal of "one freebusy call per delegationCredential" for uncached calendars

  - description: "[PostHog Analytics] feat: Make bulk delete endpoint the main use case"
    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## Problem
        
        Person deletion frequently comes up as a pain point and often requires multiple queries in order to do something straightforward.
        
        Rather than add yet another endpoint I think we should consolidate around the `bulk_delete` endpoint with one method to rule them all. That way you can delete persons and/or their events and/or their recordings without needing to look them up simplifying the whole thing
        
        ## Changes
        
        - [x] Modifies the endpoint to support these cases
        - [x] Marks the old methods as deprecated and hides them from the API docs
        
        ## How did you test this code?
        
        - [x] Added tests

        ## Summary
        
        Follow-up to #2805 - the `echo | head` approach still triggered SIGPIPE in CI.
        
        ## The fix
        
        ```bash
        # Before: still has a pipe that can cause SIGPIPE
        ALL_TAGS=$(git tag --sort=-creatordate)
        LATEST_TAG=$(echo "$ALL_TAGS" | head -n 1)
        
        # After: no pipes at all - read is a bash builtin
        ALL_TAGS=$(git tag --sort=-creatordate)
        read -r LATEST_TAG <<< "$ALL_TAGS"
        ```
        
        `read -r VAR <<< "$DATA"` reads the first line from a here-string without any pipes.
        
        ## Test plan
        
        - [ ] Trigger release workflow and verify no SIGPIPE errors

  - description: "[Polar.sh] Avoid unnecessary customer meter update triggers"
    vars:
      pr_body: |
        Prevents unnecessary `customer_meter.update_customer` tasks for orgs without meters and non-meter-related system events (like `benefit_granted`, which is how I discovered this)
        
        Changes:
        
        - Only call `touch_meters()` for user events or meter-related system events (`meter_credited`, `meter_reset`)
        - Check if organizations have active meters before touching
        
        ---
        
        It actually caught me by surprise that we call `ingested` on system events at all. Is this by design or did this slip in unnoticed? If I read the code for `ingested()`, there's actually nothing in there that has to do with system events.
        
        I was wondering if instead of this fix, we could also just do a simple check on `event.source == "user"` before calling the `ingested` method.
        
        Edit: I found that this change was intentional in https://github.com/polarsource/polar/commit/c2525565a1fb5d0a61686c5b243106d85ad503b9. From that lens, I think this PR is worth pursuing, as we've added some things in this `ingested` callback that is really user-event specific and we should opt-out of it when the created system events are irrelevant to that logic.

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## What does this PR do?
        
        Adds documentation hyperlinks for webhook versions across the webhook management UI. Users can now quickly access the payload documentation for the specific webhook version they're using or viewing.
        
        **Changes:**
        - Added `WEBHOOK_VERSION_DOCS` mapping and `getWebhookVersionDocsUrl()` helper in `packages/features/webhooks/lib/constants.ts`
        - Added external link icon next to the version selector on the **New Webhook** page
        - Added external link icon next to the version selector on the **Edit Webhook** page
        - Added external link icon next to the version badge in the **Webhook List** view
        - Added `webhook_version_docs` translation key with version interpolation
        
        This improves developer experience by providing easy access to webhook payload documentation directly from the UI.
        
        ## Visual Demo (For contributors especially)
        
        #### Image Demo (if applicable):
        
        | Location | Before | After |
        |----------|--------|-------|
        | Webhook List | Version badge only | Version badge + external link icon |
        | New/Edit Webhook | Version dropdown only | Version dropdown + external link icon |
        
        The external link icon (↗) appears next to the version badge/selector and opens the version-specific documentation in a new tab. Hovering shows tooltip: "View payload documentation for version 2021-10-20"
        
        ## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)
        
        - [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).
        - [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). N/A - This links to existing docs, no doc changes needed.
        - [ ] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.
        
        ## How should this be tested?
        
        1. Navigate to **Settings → Developer → Webhooks**
        2. **Webhook List View:**
           - Verify each webhook shows an external link icon (↗) next to the version badge
           - Hover over the icon - should show tooltip "View payload documentation for version 2021-10-20"
           - Click the icon - should open docs page in new tab
        3. **New Webhook Page:**
           - Click "New" to create a webhook
           - Verify external link icon appears next to the version dropdown in the header
           - Hover and click to verify tooltip and link work
        4. **Edit Webhook Page:**
           - Click "Edit" on an existing webhook
           - Verify external link icon appears next to the version dropdown
           - Verify tooltip shows correct version and link opens docs
        
        **Expected behavior:**
        - Icon should be vertically centered with adjacent elements
        - Tooltip should display: "View payload documentation for version {version}"
        - Link should open: `https://cal.com/docs/developing/guides/automation/webhooks#2021-10-20`

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## What does this PR do?
        
        Converts CRM, Calendar, Payment, and Analytics services from exporting classes to exporting factory functions that return interface types. This prevents SDK types (HubSpot, Stripe, jsforce, etc.) from leaking into TypeScript's emitted `.d.ts` files.
        
        **Additionally**, this PR sets up TypeScript project references so that `@calcom/trpc` consumes prebuilt `.d.ts` files from `@calcom/app-store` instead of typechecking source files. This **reduces the tRPC build file count from 7,733 to 5,618 files (27% reduction)**.

        **Background**: When TypeScript emits `.d.ts` files for exported classes, it includes private fields. If a class has `private hubspotClient: hubspot.Client`, TypeScript must resolve the full HubSpot SDK type graph (1,822 `.d.ts` files). By exporting factory functions typed as returning interfaces (e.g., `CRM`, `Calendar`), the emitted declarations only reference the interface types, not SDK internals.
        
        **Services modified**:
        - CRM: hubspot, salesforce, closecom, pipedrive-crm, zoho-bigin, zohocrm (6)
        - Calendar: all 13 calendar services
        - Payment: stripe, paypal, alby, btcpayserver, hitpay, mock-payment-app (6)
        - Analytics: dub (1)
        
        Video adapters were audited and already use factory pattern - no changes needed.
        
        ## Updates since last revision
        
        **Latest - Code cleanup:**
        - Removed explanatory comments about factory functions from payment handlers (`deletePayment.ts`, `handleNoShowFee.ts`, `handlePaymentRefund.ts`, `handlePayment.ts`) and test file (`getCalendarsEvents.test.ts`)
        - Fixed indentation in payment files
        - Updated `.gitignore` to use `*.tsbuildinfo` pattern to catch all TypeScript build info files (not just `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`)
        
        **Previous - Renamed factory functions to `Build*` naming convention:**
        - Renamed all factory functions to use `Build*` prefix to make it clear they are factory functions, not classes:
          - Calendar: `create*CalendarService` → `BuildCalendarSe

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## What does this PR do?
        
        Consolidates the `changes` and `check-label` jobs into a single `prepare` job in the PR workflow to reduce the number of sequential jobs that run before the main CI work begins.
        
        **Changes:**
        - Merged `changes` job (file change detection) and `check-label` job (E2E label check) into a single `prepare` job
        - Updated all downstream jobs to reference `needs.prepare.outputs.*` instead of the previous separate job outputs
        - Updated job dependencies throughout the workflow
        
        **Note:** The `deps` job remains separate because it uses a reusable workflow (`uses: ./.github/workflows/yarn-install.yml`), which cannot be combined with regular job steps in GitHub Actions.

        ## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)
        
        - [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).
        - [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). N/A - CI workflow change only.
        - [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works. N/A - This is a CI workflow refactor; the workflow itself will validate correctness when it runs.
        
        ## How should this be tested?
        
        This PR can be tested by observing the CI workflow execution on this PR:
        1. Verify the `prepare` job runs and outputs all expected values (`has-files-requiring-all-checks`, `has_companion`, `commit-sha`, `run-e2e`)
        2. Verify downstream jobs correctly receive and use these outputs
        3. Verify the workflow behaves the same as before (jobs run/skip based on the same conditions)

        ## Summary by cubic
        Fixed the missing three-dots menu in iOS availability list items by giving the trigger a fixed hit target and tightening layout spacing. The menu is now consistently visible and easy to tap.
        
        - **Bug Fixes**
          - Wrapped the menu trigger in a 32x32 bordered container to prevent it from being squeezed off-screen.
          - Adjusted row layout: added horizontal padding, set white background, and ensured the main content uses flex-1 with margin.
          - Added accessibilityRole="button" to the schedule Pressable.

  - description: "[Cal.com] feat: upgrade apps/web to Next.js 16.1.0"
    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## What does this PR do?
        
        Upgrades the `apps/web` package from Next.js 15.5.9 to 16.1.0, along with the related `@next/bundle-analyzer` package.
        
        Next.js 16.1 brings several improvements ([release notes](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16-1)):
        - Turbopack file system caching for `next dev` is now stable and enabled by default
        - New experimental bundle analyzer
        - Easier debugging with `next dev --inspect`
        - Improved handling of `serverExternalPackages` for transitive dependencies
        - ~20MB smaller installs
        
        ### Breaking Changes Addressed
        
        1. **Middleware renamed to Proxy** - Next.js 16 [deprecates the `middleware` file convention](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-to-proxy) and renames it to `proxy`. Renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` and the handler function accordingly.
        
        2. **Turbopack as default bundler** - Added `turbopack: {}` to `next.config.js` to enable Turbopack for production builds (required when webpack config exists).
        
        3. **revalidateTag API change** - Next.js 16.1 requires a second `profile` parameter for `revalidateTag()`. Updated all calls to use `"max"` profile for stale-while-revalidate semantics.
        
        4. **Route segment config must be statically analyzable** - Turbopack cannot analyze re-exported config. Inlined the `config` object in 4 webhook API routes (alby, btcpayserver, paypal, stripepayment).
        
        5. **Async params in layouts** - Updated routing-forms layout to await the `params` promise per Next.js 16 requirements.
        
        ### Updates since last revision
        
        - Renamed `middleware.test.ts` → `proxy.test.ts` and updated all imports to reference the new `proxy` module
        - Removed `runtime: "nodejs"` from proxy config (not allowed in Next.js 16 Proxy files - they always run on Node.js)

        ## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)
        
        - [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).
        - [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). N/A - no documentation changes needed.
        - [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.
        
        ## How should this be tested?
        
        1. Run `yarn dev` and verify the development server starts correctly with Turbopack
        2. Run `yarn build` in apps/web and verify the production build completes
        3. Verify the app functions correctly in both dev and production modes
        4. Test cache invalidation flows to ensure `revalidateTag` with "max" profile works correctly
        
        ## Human Review Checklist
        
        - [ ] Verify `yarn dev` works with the new Next.js version
        - [ ] Verify `yarn build` completes successfully
        - [ ] Confirm `proxy.ts` (formerly `middleware.ts`) functions correctly for rate limiting, CSP headers, and routing
        - [ ] Verify cache invalidation still works with the new `revalidateTag` signature
        - [ ] Check that webhook endpoints still work with inlined config
        - [ ] Verify routing forms work correctly with async params change

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        Fixes #13 
        
        Used Stripe's methodology for calculating churn rate as mentioned by Sahil here https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/issues/13#issuecomment-3372005841
        
        > The churn rate is measured by the sum of churned subscribers in the past 30 days divided by the number of active subscribers as of 30 days ago, plus any new subscribers in those 30 days.
        
        Also, a caching layer was added for Large Sellers, as they would have a lot of products, and re-computing data repeatedly would provide a very poor user experience. Therefore, a ChurnCache model was created to store the details.

  - description: "[Gumroad] feat: Add customer download counts in dashboard drawer"
    vars:
      pr_body: |
        fixes: #1562 
        ## Summary
        Added download count display in the Customers dashboard drawer to help sellers detect illegal file sharing and verify customer download activity.
        
        ## What & Why
        **Problem:** Sellers had no way to see how many times customers downloaded their products, making it impossible to detect if customers were sharing download links illegally or to verify refund claims about never downloading.
        
        **Solution:** Surface the existing `url_redirects.uses` data in the Customer drawer UI.
        
        ## AI Disclosure
        Model: Claude(Sonnet 4.5) via Cursor IDE
        Used for:
        Codebase exploration to understand data flow from Purchase → UrlRedirect → CustomerPresenter → CustomersPage
        Writing test cases for both unit and system tests
        Addressing reviewer feedback (moving logic from frontend to backend, making download_count optional)
        All AI-generated code was manually reviewed and modified to match existing Gumroad patterns.

  - description: "[Cal.com] refactor: split tRPC build into server and react phases"
    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## What does this PR do?
        
        This PR improves tRPC build performance and correctness by:
        
        1. **Importing `AppRouter` from generated types** - Client-side code now imports `AppRouter` from pre-generated type declarations instead of traversing the entire server router tree (458+ files).
        
        2. **Splitting the build into two phases** - The tRPC build is now separated into `build:server` and `build:react` commands that run sequentially. This ensures server types are generated before the react code tries to import them.
        
        3. **Separating server and react entrypoints** - `@calcom/trpc` root no longer exports react code. All 89 consumer files have been updated to import from `@calcom/trpc/react` instead. This fixes the "boundary leak" where server builds were pulling in react code through transitive imports via `@calcom/features`.
        
        **Changes:**
        - Create type bridge file at `packages/trpc/react/app-router.ts` that re-exports `AppRouter` from generated types
        - Update `packages/trpc/react/trpc.ts` to import from the local bridge file
        - Create `tsconfig.server.json` for server-only type generation (outputs to `types/server/`)
        - Create `tsconfig.react.json` for react type generation (outputs to `types/react/`)
        - Update `package.json` build script to run server build first, then react build
        - Remove react exports from `packages/trpc/index.ts` (now just contains comments explaining the separation)
        - Update 89 files to import from `@calcom/trpc/react` instead of `@calcom/trpc`
        
        **TypeScript Performance Impact:** By separating the entrypoints, the server type generation no longer traverses the entire react/client type graph. This should improve local DX and compilation times.
        
        ### Updates since last revision
        
        **Schema extraction refactor (addressing PR review feedback):**
        - Created `packages/features/eventtypes/lib/schemas.ts` with just `createEventTypeInput` and `EventTypeDuplicateInput` schemas
        - Updated `types.ts` to re-export schemas from the new server-safe location
        - Updated tRPC schema files (`create.schema.ts`, `duplicate.schema.ts`) to import from `schemas.ts`
        - Deleted `types.server.ts` - this avoids the ~200 lines of duplication that was flagged in review
        
        **Previous boundary leak fixes:**
        - **WorkflowRepository.ts**: Import `WorkflowListType` from `@calcom/ee/workflows/lib/types` instead of from the React component `WorkflowListPage.tsx`
        - **Slots type extraction**: Created `packages/features/calendars/lib/slots.ts` with server-safe `Slots` and `SlotInfo` types
        - **BookerEvent type extraction**: Created `packages/features/bookings/types.server.ts` with minimal `BookerEventForAppData` type for app-store utils
        - **ChildrenEventType extraction**: Created `packages/features/eventtypes/lib/childrenEventType.ts` with server-safe types
        - **Segment.test.tsx fix**: Updated mock path from `@calcom/trpc` to `@calcom/trpc/react`

        **Requested by:** keith@cal.com (@keithwillcode)
        
        ## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)
        
        - [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).
        - [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a documentation change. N/A - internal build optimization.
        - [ ] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works. N/A - build/type system change verified by CI.
        
        ## How should this be tested?
        
        1. Run `yarn workspace @calcom/trpc build:server` to generate server types in `types/server/`
        2. Run `yarn workspace @calcom/trpc build:react` to generate react types in `types/react/`
        3. Or run `yarn workspace @calcom/trpc build` to run both in sequence
        4. Verify the bridge file at `react/app-router.ts` can resolve `../types/server/routers/_app`
        
        **Human review checklist:**
        - [ ] Verify `tsconfig.server.json` only includes `./server` and excludes `./react`
        - [ ] Verify `tsconfig.rea

  - description: "[Gumroad] fix: Wrap product names in delete modal"
    vars:
      pr_body: |
        # Problem
        
        The delete product modal is misaligned and cut off on mobile
        
        ### Action Performed
        1. On mobile view, go to https://gumroad.com/products
        2. Create a product with this name "FocusFlow – Productivity Planner v1.0"
        3. From the product list, select "Delete permanently" for that product
        
        # Root cause analysis
        This issue was introduced in this PR https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/pull/1046
        
        Where we add `className="whitespace-nowrap lg:px-8"` to all `td` tag [here](https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/pull/1046/files#diff-0944edf17f3bbb97f6ff695b8298f1bc49beba9e73335542fcab98a634a945cdR164)
        
        But we don't need `whitespace-nowrap` for the last `td` since it only contains the action popover, and it causes this issue.
        
        
        <img width="832" height="258" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23fc871b-39d6-4cc6-91bb-887df6e53cb3" />
        
        
        Before that PR, the other `td` tag has `style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}` while the `td` tag for action popover doesn't have that style. So we should only add `lg:px-8` class to the action popover `td`, without `whitespace-nowrap` class
        
        # Solution
        Remove the unnecessary `whitespace-nowrap` from the last `td` tag on both `MembershipsTable.tsx` and `ProductsTable.tsx`
        
        # Alternative solutions
        None

        ## Problem
        
        A required property `productTourId` got added to AuthorizedUrlListLogicProps but not all code that used that type had the field added to it.
        
        ## Changes
        
        Adds the productTourId field to webAnalyticsFilterLogic file to get the type checker to pass

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## What does this PR do?
        
        This PR fixes inconsistent "New" button sizing between the Event Types page and Workflows page on desktop.
        The `button` variant was missing `md:min-w-min md:min-h-min` classes that the `fab` variant has, causing the Workflows button to render smaller.
        
        - Fixes #26065 
        - Fixes [CAL-6958](https://linear.app/calcom/issue/CAL-6958/new-button-sizing-inconsistent-between-workflows-and-event-types-pages)
        
        ## Visual Demo (For contributors especially)
        
        ### Before:
        - Workflows "New" button appears smaller than homepage button
        
        <img width="1918" height="971" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-19 232516" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc1b00a4-9c55-4cb5-a4fa-4527848fe011" />
        
        
        
        ### After:
        
        - Both buttons now have identical sizing on desktop
        
        
        <img width="1918" height="957" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-19 232537" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91c4ff95-5014-455c-ade7-22a3e9a2e66f" />
        
        ## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)
        
        - [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).
        - [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). If N/A, write N/A here and check the checkbox.
        - [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.
        
        ## How should this be tested?
        
        1. Go to Event Types page - note the "New" button size
        2. Go to Workflows page - compare the "New" button
        3. Both should now look identical

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## Problem
        
        Making edits to large JSON blobs in the feature flags payload input was very slow.
        
        Resolves https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/42405
        
        ## Changes
        
        Memoized JSON serialization of the value so we're not reserializing on every keystroke. Switched to `CodeEditorResizable` for auto-resizing.
        
        I also took this opportunity to match the placeholder styling to the monaco input for consistency.

        ## How did you test this code?
        
        I ran a rough benchmark locally to measure the impact and verify this fix improved performance.
        
        Input lag when editing JSON payload (before and after)
        
        | JSON Size         | Before (Avg) | After (Avg) | Improvement |
        |-------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
        | Small             | 16ms         | 16ms        | -           |

        Key Changes
        
        - Long tasks: 41 → 0
        - Total blocking time: 4,639ms → 0ms
        - Consistent ~16ms latency regardless of JSON size

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## The Problem                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                              
        When a new developer runs bin/start, it calls bin/start-frontend which executes:                           
        bin/turbo --filter=@posthog/frontend start-vite                                                                     
                                                                                                                            
        The start-vite script in frontend/package.json:44 was running:                                                      
        "start-vite": "pnpm build:products && concurrently ... \"vite --host 0.0.0.0\" ..."                                 
                                                                                                                            
        However, the old esbuild-based scripts (build and start-http) included an additional step:                          
        "build": "pnpm copy-scripts && pnpm build:esbuild"                                                                  
        "start-http": "pnpm clean && pnpm copy-scripts && pnpm build:esbuild --dev"                                         
                                                                                                                            
        The copy-scripts command (frontend/bin/copy-posthog-js) copies built posthog-js files (array.js, surveys.js,        
        recorder files, etc.) from node_modules/posthog-js/dist/ to dist/ so they can be served by PostHog's CDN. This step 
        was missing from the vite flow.
        
        Left, was original copy-scripts bash script, right is the new vite plugin

      pr_body: |
        ## What does this PR do?
        
        - Ensures missing i18n keys fall back to English by merging locale translations with bundled English and caching the merged result. Applies to both dynamic import and HTTP fetch paths to keep behavior consistent.
        
        - **Bug Fixes**
          - Added mergeWithEnglishFallback to combine locale and English translations.
          - Applied fallback in both import and HTTP code paths.
          - Cache now stores merged translations to prevent missing keys across requests.
        
        
        ## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)
        
        - [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).

        - [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.
        
        ## How should this be tested?

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        Part of #1055 
        
        * Removes the old `grid` class to Tailwind, using container queries rather than min/max widths - easier to visualise IMO and it works with built-in Tailwind utilities rather than needing custom values
        * Removes the `override` class we were using to prevent Tailwind grid styles from conflicting
        
        ## Screenshots
        
        ### Visual changes
        
        Minor changes to the breakpoints in the product card layout. Effectively I increased the min width of the cards a bit because it simplifies the classes and IMO looks better anyway.

  - description: "[PostHog Analytics] Disable screensaver by default"
    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## Changes
        
        The screensaver is disabled by default.
        
        Rationale: Look, I'm not the biggest fan of the posthog website. I found it entertaining for the first few days, and now I mostly find it annoying and I yearn for a regular browsable website. 
        
        However, the screensaver is next-level annoying. When bringing up side-by-side windows with docs, or move between browser tabs looking for that one important tab I had open, the screensaver is by far the biggest usability hinderance on the posthog website.
        
        I know the setting can be changed, and I changed it myself long ago. However, this comes up probably ~weekly in our internal Slack, and so instead of continuing to remind people how to change your obscure setting, I am proposing this PR to fix the issue once and for all.
        
        I quote [How not to be boring](https://posthog.com/blog/brand):
        
        > So, as frustrating as it might be to spend extra time and effort on something "superficial" like a website, remember you're providing your product to human beings. **Everyone judges books by their covers.**

        - [x] PostHog product names are in [title case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case). It's "Product Analytics" not "Product analytics".

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## What does this PR do?
        
        This PR continues the work from #25859 to eradicate `trpc` imports from `packages/features`. The dependency graph should be:
        
        ```
        apps/web -> packages/trpc -> packages/features
        ```
        
        Components in `packages/features` should not import from `trpc`. This PR migrates the workflow page components to `apps/web/modules` where they can safely import from `trpc`.
        
        ### Changes:
        - Move `packages/features/ee/workflows/pages/index.tsx` → `apps/web/modules/workflows/views/workflows-listing-view.tsx`
        - Move `packages/features/ee/workflows/pages/workflow.tsx` → `apps/web/modules/workflows/views/workflow-view.tsx`
        - Update page imports in `apps/web/app/(use-page-wrapper)/workflows/` to use new paths
        - Convert relative imports to absolute `@calcom/features` imports
        - Remove unused `Filter` component and its related imports (was dead code)
        
        ## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)
        
        - [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).
        - [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). N/A - no documentation changes needed.
        - [ ] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.
        
        ## How should this be tested?
        
        1. Navigate to `/workflows` and verify the workflows listing page renders correctly
        2. Click on a workflow to navigate to `/workflows/[id]` and verify the workflow detail page renders correctly
        3. Verify creating, editing, and deleting workflows still works as expected
        
        ## Checklist

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## What does this PR do?
        
        Fixes webhook payload inconsistency where Daily video meetings show the provider's direct URL in `videoCallData.url` instead of the Cal.com public video link. Normalizes Daily webhook payloads so `videoCallData.url` uses the Cal.com link (matching `metadata.videoCallUrl`), while keeping other providers unchanged.
        
        - Fixes #25604
        - Fixes [CAL-6869](https://linear.app/calcom/issue/CAL-6869/show-cal-video-url-in-webhook-payload)

        ## Summary by cubic
        Adds guests and updated attendee noShow status to no-show webhook payloads, and includes the noShowHost flag for host no-shows. This makes downstream consumers receive accurate participant data.
        
        - **New Features**
          - Guest no-show: after marking attendees, include updated attendees and a guests array (attendees excluding hosts) in AFTER_GUESTS_CAL_VIDEO_NO_SHOW payloads.
          - Host no-show: set booking.noShowHost and include it in AFTER_HOSTS_CAL_VIDEO_NO_SHOW payloads; also return updated attendees.
          - Webhook payloads now conditionally include noShowHost (host no-show) and guests (guest no-show).
          - getBooking selects noShowHost.
          - Tests expanded to cover updated payloads and attendee updates.

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## 📋 Summary
        
        File downloadables view in product benefits was limited to 31 items due to default pagination. Users with many files couldn't access older uploads.
        
        ## 🎯 What
        
        **Backend:**
        - Added `name` query parameter to `/v1/files/` endpoint for case-insensitive partial matching using `ilike`
        
        **Frontend:**
        - Increased file fetch limit from default (10) to 100 (API maximum)
        - Added search input with real-time filtering by file name
        - Added client-side pagination showing 20 files per page
        - Display file counts and clear search button
        
        ## 🤔 Why
        
        Products with >31 downloadable files were inaccessible due to:
        1. Frontend defaulting to 10 items per page
        2. No search capability to find specific files
        3. No pagination controls to navigate beyond first page
        
        ## 🔧 How
        
        **Hybrid approach:**
        - Server: Added optional name filter to files endpoint
        - Client: Fetches up to 100 files, filters/paginates locally
        
        **Key implementation details:**
        - Search input appears when >5 files exist
        - Pagination resets to page 1 on search query change (via `useEffect`)
        - Drag-and-drop update logic optimized from O(n²) to O(n) using Map
        - SQLAlchemy `ilike` handles parameter binding safely
        
        Handles products with up to 100 downloadables. Beyond that, server-side pagination infrastructure exists but requires pagination state management in the editing flow.
        
        ## 🧪 Testing
        
        - [x] I have tested these changes locally
        - [x] All existing tests pass (`uv run task test` for backend, `pnpm test` for frontend)
        - [ ] I have added new tests for new functionality
        - [x] I have run linting and type checking (`uv run task lint && uv run task lint_types` for backend)
        
        ### Test Instructions
        
        1. Create a product with >40 downloadable files
        2. Navigate to product edit → downloadables section
        3. Verify search input appears and filters files by name
        4. Verify pagination controls show 20 files per page
        5. Test drag-and-drop reordering still works
        6. Clear search and navigate pages
        
        ## 🖼️ Screenshots/Recordings
        
        _Screenshots needed: file list with search bar, pagination controls, and file count display_
        
        ## 📝 Additional Notes
        
        **Limitations:** 
        - Client can access max 100 files in a single load
        - For products with >100 files, server-side pagination would require maintaining page state across form interactions
        
        **Alternatives considered:**
        - Full server-side pagination: Requires complex state management in benefit form
        - Infinite scroll: Poor UX for reordering files

        ## 📋 Summary
        
        Adds Conductor workspace configuration file to enable streamlined local development setup and execution.
        
        ## 🎯 What
        
        Added `conductor.json` with scripts for automated environment setup and running the API server.
        
        ## 🤔 Why
        
        The Conductor configuration enables consistent, reproducible development setup across the team with a single command.
        
        ## 🔧 How
        
        The configuration includes:
        - `setup`: Copies environment files, starts Docker services, installs dependencies, builds email templates, and runs database migrations
        - `run`: Starts the backend API server

        - Fix the CodeBlock keys to be unique, even when two blocks are set to the same language (i.e bash like in the llm analytics page)
        
        Prevents the following warning on the LLM analytics docs:

    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## Changes
        
        _**what if you could edit code snippets in docs and copy and paste working code, without the back and forth of updating boilerplate code w/ placeholders?**_
        
        this PR adds edit mode to code blocks, useful for docs where users need to customize their config (API keys, hosts, etc.) before copying. 
        
        here's how I built it:
        - added a new `edit` prop for code blocks (`CodeBlockProps`, `SingleCodeBlockProps`, `MdxCodeBlock`, and `MetaStringProps` types)
        - `editedCode` state tracks user changes w/ `originalCode` storing initial code for reset
        - to use it:
        	- in MDX code blocks: ```javascript edit -- yes it's that simple! this enables editing PER code block
        	- for react types: `<SingleCodeBlock edit>` and `<CodeBlock edit={true}>`
        - also added some tailwind updates to align other header buttons w/ _new_ styling guidelines (`hover:bg-accent` instead of `hover:bg-light)
        
        > **Note:** this also lays the groundwork for interactive "try it out" sandbox features in docs. `editedCode` tracks edits, `onCodeChange` props fire on every keystroke, and there's a reset functionality for cleanup - all we would need later is the "run" functionality and output panel 😸 
        
        Behavior:
        - Edit appears in code snippet header when enabled on that snippet
        - Clicking edit opens a textarea OVERLAY for editing
        - Reset button appears only when a code snippet has been modified
        - Copy button copies the user's edited code (when they are in edit mode of course, not the original code) - copies original code when not in edit mode
        - clicking outside the code block closers the editor w/ edits preserved  _**open to feedback on this choice... I couldn't decide on whether to add a done button, or what the best UX was here**_
        - IMPORTANT: ALL EDITS ARE CLIENT SIDE, NOT PERSISTED so a page refresh will reset the code snippets AND this does not impact copy to markdown/markdown service

        Adds a step to the release workflow to rename the changeset PR so that it includes the version of the packages to be released. This was always a pain to do manually and it's easy to miss when merging the changeset PR.
        
        Also applied a small fix for the OIDC publishing flow, by adding the `id-token: write` permission to the workflow.

  - description: "[Antiwork] Migrate from Slack to email notifications (closes #1075)"
    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## Summary
        
        This PR migrates all team notifications from Slack to email and completely removes the Slack integration from the codebase.
        
        ## Changes
        
        ### Email Notification System
        - ✅ Created 4 email templates using React Email:
          - `lib/emails/dailyReport.tsx` - Daily summary reports
          - `lib/emails/weeklyReport.tsx` - Weekly team performance reports
          - `lib/emails/vipNotification.tsx` - VIP customer notifications
          - `lib/emails/ticketAlert.tsx` - Ticket response time alerts
        - ✅ Implemented email sending functions in `lib/emails/teamNotifications.ts`
        - ✅ Added email notification preferences to userProfiles schema (opt-in/opt-out support)
        
        ### Slack Integration Removal
        - ✅ Removed all Slack code (60+ files including lib/slack/, API routes, UI components)
        - ✅ Updated all background jobs to use email instead of Slack
        - ✅ Removed Slack dependencies (@slack/web-api, @slack/types)
        - ✅ Removed Slack environment variables (SLACK_CLIENT_ID, SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET, SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET)
        
        ### Database Migration
        - ✅ Created migration `db/drizzle/0124_remove_slack_integration.sql`
        - ✅ Drops 2 tables (agent_messages, agent_threads)
        - ✅ Removes 14 Slack-related columns across multiple tables
        - ✅ Safe re-runnable migration using IF EXISTS clauses
        
        ### Test Updates
        - ✅ Removed Slack-related test files
        - ✅ Updated remaining tests to remove Slack mocks and expectations
        - ✅ No Slack references remain in test suite
        
        ## Migration Impact
        
        **8 Integration Points Migrated:**
        1. Daily summary reports → Email
        2. Weekly team performance reports → Email
        3. VIP customer notifications → Email
        4. VIP ticket response time alerts → Email
        5. Assigned ticket response time alerts → Email
        6. Slack Agent Integration → Removed
        7. Interactive Actions (Respond/Assign/Close) → Removed
        8. Link Unfurling → Removed
        
        **Files Changed:** 30 files changed, 316 insertions(+), 1,309 deletions(-)
        
        ## Testing
        
        - ✅ All email templates use existing Resend infrastructure
        - ✅ User preferences stored in userProfiles.preferences.emailNotifications
        - ✅ All Slack imports removed from active code (verified: 0 matches)
        - ✅ All database schema changes defined in migration file
        - ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
        
        ## AI Disclosure
        
        🤖 This PR was developed with assistance from Claude (Anthropic) for:
        - Implementing email notification system
        - Systematic removal of Slack integration code
        - Creating database migration
        - Comprehensive verification of all changes
        
        All code was reviewed and verified to ensure correctness and adherence to project standards.
        
        ## Deployment Notes
        
        **Before deploying:**
        1. Run database migration: `db/drizzle/0124_remove_slack_integration.sql`
        2. Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured (already in use)
        3. Notify team members about the change from Slack to email notifications
        
        **After deploying:**
        1. Verify daily reports are sent via email
        2. Verify VIP notifications are sent via email
        3. Remove Slack environment variables from production
        
        ## Closes
        
        Closes #1075

        ### Self-Review Comments
        
        **Database Migration Safety:**
        - Migration uses `DROP ... IF EXISTS` for safe re-execution
        - No data migration needed (existing Slack data remains in nullable fields)
        - All indexes dropped before columns are removed
        
        **Email Notification Design:**
        - All team members in workspace receive notifications by default
        - Users can opt-out via preferences (dailyReports, weeklyReports, vipAlerts, ticketAlerts)
        - Email links point to Helper dashboard for quick access
        
        **Backward Compatibility:**
        - No breaking changes to existing features
        - Slack data in database is preserved but unused
        - All functionality maintained, only notification delivery method changed

        The current example doesn't work anymore. `FirecrawlApp` is now `FirecrawlAppV1`, and `ScrapeResponse` isn't exposed. So I updated the example to use the updated SDK, trying to keep this new example as close to the original as I could.

        # Add customer notes section to sidebar
        
        ## Summary
        Adds a notes section to the Customer info sidebar allowing support agents to store reference information (like Gumroad profile links) about customers who email from addresses not associated with their accounts.
        
        **Key Changes:**
        - **Database:** New `customer_notes` table with email-based association, timestamps, and RLS
        - **API:** Extended customers tRPC router with CRUD endpoints for notes
        - **UI:** New `CustomerNotes` component in conversation sidebar with add/edit/delete functionality
        - **Data Layer:** Full CRUD operations with user authorization
        
        **Technical Notes:**
        - Notes are associated with customer email addresses (not `platformCustomers.id`) to handle cases where customers email from non-primary accounts
        - Only note creators can edit/delete their own notes (enforced in data layer)
        - Notes persist across all conversations with the same customer email
        
        ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
        **⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY - This PR could not be fully tested locally due to database environment issues**
        
        - [ ] **Database migration executes successfully** - Verify the new `customer_notes` table is created with proper indexes and RLS
        - [ ] **UI renders correctly and matches existing design** - Check the notes section appears in customer sidebar with proper styling
        - [ ] **CRUD operations work end-to-end** - Test adding, editing, and deleting notes through the UI
        - [ ] **Authorization works correctly** - Verify users can only edit/delete their own notes, but can view all notes
        - [ ] **Notes display consistently** - Check that notes for a customer show up across different conversations with the same email address

  - description: "[Anthropic] Fix context management for SDK 0.69.0 and improve documentat"
    vars:
      pr_body: |
        ## Summary
        
        Fixes the memory cookbook to work with the latest anthropic SDK (0.69.0) and improves documentation around context clearing behavior.
        
        ## Changes
        
        ### SDK 0.69.0 Compatibility
        - **Pass `context_management` as direct parameter** instead of `extra_body`
          - SDK 0.69.0 now accepts `context_management` as a top-level parameter
          - Updated `demo_helpers.py` and `code_review_demo.py`
        - **Update response handling for Pydantic objects**
          - Use `getattr()` instead of `.get()` for accessing response attributes
          - `context_management` response is now a Pydantic model, not a dict
        
        ### Context Clearing Configuration
        - **Lower `clear_at_least` threshold from 3000 to 50 tokens**
          - Memory tool operations have small results (~50-150 tokens each)
          - Previous threshold was too high, preventing clearing from triggering
          - Add inline documentation explaining the low threshold
        - **Add explanatory notes in notebook**
          - Explain why token savings are small in this demo
          - Provide guidance for production configurations
          - Document that larger tool results would save more tokens
        
        ## Testing
        
        Tested with anthropic SDK 0.69.0. Context clearing now triggers correctly:
        - Clears 2 tool uses saving ~66 tokens per clearing
        - Memory files persist across context clearing
        - Notebook runs without errors
        
        ## Notes
        
        - Users will need SDK 0.69.0 (released 2025-09-29) to use `context_management` as a direct parameter
        - The demo uses low thresholds suitable for memory operations; production apps with larger tool results should use higher values (3000-5000 tokens)
