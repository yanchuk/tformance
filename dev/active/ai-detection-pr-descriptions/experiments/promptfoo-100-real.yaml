      Lines: +198/-1\nLabels: release\nTime to first review: 0.1 hours\n\nDescription:\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen using `instrumentation-client.ts`\
      \ in Next.js, PostHog initializes once per app launch. This means feature flag values don't update on subsequent client-side\
      \ navigations, even if a middleware evaluates fresh flags server-side. Users need a way to inject server-evaluated flag\
      \ values into the client SDK without making additional network requests. This is applicable to other single-page applications\
      \ with similar initialization methods.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/43980\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\
      \n\r\nAdds a new public method `posthog.updateFlags(flags, payloads?, options?)` that:\r\n\r\n- Injects feature flag\
      \ values from an external source (e.g., server-side evaluation, edge middleware)\r\n- Fires `onFeatureFlags` callbacks\
      \ so React hooks auto-update\r\n- Works with `advanced_disable_flags: true` for server-only evaluation patterns\r\n\
      - Supports `{ merge: true }` option to merge with existing flags instead of replacing\r\n\r\nThis is the foundational\
      \ primitive: the transport/sync layer (cookies, navigation detection, race conditions) is a separate concern requiring\
      \ more careful consideration.\r\n\r\n## Release info Sub-libraries affected\r\n\r\n### Libraries affected\r\n\r\n- [x]\

      Time to first review: 0.1 hours\n\nDescription:\nThis pull request introduces important security improvements to the\
      \ SQL parameterization logic, specifically to prevent SQL injection attacks. The main change is the use of a proper\
      \ SQL literal escaping function when substituting parameters, and a comprehensive set of tests has been added to verify\
      \ protection against various SQL injection techniques.\r\n\r\nSecurity enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Updated `processParameterizedSql`\
      \ in `sql-parameters.ts` to use the `literal()` function from `@supabase/pg-meta/src/pg-format`, ensuring all parameter\
      \ values are safely escaped and quoted to prevent SQL injection. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-bab72f5896c222a2880990ae0979308d4c78bfd591dc9e49a60e94b94c249512R1-R2)\

      \n\r\n* Added a new test suite to `sql-parameters.test.ts` covering multiple SQL injection scenarios (single quote escape,\
      \ UNION attacks, OR 1=1, comment injection, semicolon termination, numeric injection, and batch statement injection)\
      \ to confirm that the escaping logic effectively neutralizes malicious input.\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment:\

      \ the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).\r\n- [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs\
      \ if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). If N/A, write N/A here\
      \ and check the checkbox.\r\n- [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my\
      \ feature works.\r\n\r\n## How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1. **Setup:**\r\n   - Create an event type with \"Requires\
      \ confirmation\" enabled\r\n   - Create a webhook for `BOOKING_REQUESTED` trigger event\r\n\r\n2. **Test Steps:**\r\n\

      Time to first review: 0.1 hours\n\nDescription:\n## Problem\r\n\r\nCustomers using Azure infrastructure currently can't\
      \ export PostHog data directly to Azure Blob Storage. This adds Azure Blob as a new batch export destination.\r\n\r\n\
      Addresses #41383\r\n\r\nThis is PR 1 of 2 (with backend changes only). The API blocks creation until the frontend form\
      \ is added in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nAdds `AzureBlob` as a new batch export destination type with\
      \ a Temporal workflow (`azure-blob-export`) that uses the existing internal S3 staging pipeline, so no new ClickHouse\
      \ query logic needed.\r\n\r\nCredentials are stored via a new `AzureBlobIntegration` class (connection string auth).\
      \ Added Azurite emulator to docker-compose for local dev.\r\n\r\nTest suite covers end-to-end tests for format/compression\
      \ combinations, error handling, and file splitting.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this code?\r\n\r\n    # Run Azure Blob\
      \ tests (requires Azurite)\r\n    docker-compose up -d objectstorage-azure\r\n    pytest products/batch_exports/backend/tests/temporal/destinations/azure_blob/\

      \ type dropdown in the table editor.\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nThe column type dropdown is always\
      \ truncated, which means we can't differentiate between \"timestamp\" and \"timestamptz\". The placeholder text \"Choose\

      \n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nI've made 4 changes:\r\n1. improvement: the sidepanel's width was increased for\
      \ \"large\" to \"xlarge\"\r\n2. improvement: added a `title` attribute to the dropdown to make it easy to view the column\
      \ type if truncated\r\n3. improvement: \"Choose a column type...\" was changed to \"Choose a type\". The ellipsis felt\
      \ like wasted space and we already know we're picking a column type. \r\n4. fix: the value in the button is now actually\
      \ truncated. The buttons have the `truncate` class already but it doesn't apply because the children have `display:\
      \ flex`.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThe SidePanel is now wider, which allows the column type dropdown to be\
      \ fully readable:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"747\" height=\"371\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-24 at 12 35 19\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/472172e7-50c2-4082-ad1e-12665d5e3ac4\"\

      \ WelcomeToCalcomModal overflow issue where the \"Continue\" button footer was being cut off at 100% screen size. The\
      \ modal now properly handles content overflow while keeping the footer visible and accessible.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\
      \n- Added `enableOverflow` prop to `DialogContent` to enable proper scrolling behavior when content exceeds modal height\r\
      \n- Added `shrink-0` class to footer to prevent it from shrinking in flex layout and ensure it stays visible\r\n- Fixed\
      \ linter warning by changing `!p-0` to `p-0!` (Tailwind class order)\r\n\r\n**Motivation:**\r\nWhen users complete personal\
      \ onboarding and are redirected to `/event-types?welcomeToCalcomModal=true`, the welcome modal displays. At 100% screen\
      \ size, the modal content was too tall, causing the footer with the \"Continue\" button to overflow and be cut off.\
      \ This fix ensures the modal respects viewport constraints and allows content scrolling while keeping the footer accessible.\r\
      \n\r\n- Fixes #XXXX (GitHub issue number)\r\n- Fixes CAL-XXXX (Linear issue number - should be visible at the bottom\
      \ of the GitHub issue description)\r\n\r\n## Visual Demo (For contributors especially)\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n<img width=\"\

      This PR addresses [issue #2450](https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/issues/2450) by introducing a feature flag to prevent\
      \ automatic creation of new accounts when connecting via Stripe. Existing users can still log in via Stripe without\
      \ creating new accounts, maintaining current functionality.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\n1. Feature Flag:\r\n    • Added\
      \ a new environment variable DISABLE_STRIPE_SIGNUP (default: false).\r\n    • When set to true, users attempting to\
      \ sign up via Stripe will not create new accounts. Existing users will still be able to connect Stripe automatically.\r\
      \n\r\n2. Controller Changes:\r\n    • Modified app/controllers/users/oauth_controller.rb to respect the feature flag.\r\
      \n    • Before creating a new user via Stripe, the controller now checks if ENV[\"DISABLE_STRIPE_SIGNUP\"] is enabled.\r\
      \n    • No other login flows are affected.\r\n\r\n3. Safety & Backwards Compatibility:\r\n    • Existing users can continue\

      Labels: size/XXL\nDraft: Yes\n\nDescription:\n## What does this PR do?\n\nImplements a comprehensive booking actions\
      \ system for the Cal.com Companion mobile app with web parity. This provides the foundation for all booking action functionality\
      \ in the mobile app.\n\n**Key changes:**\n\n1. **Centralized Action Gating** (`companion/utils/booking-actions.ts`)\
      \ - Pure function that determines visibility/enabled state for all actions (reschedule, cancel, add guests, edit location,\
      \ view recordings, session details, mark no-show) based on booking state, user role, event type settings, and network\
      \ status. Matches web's `bookingActions.ts` semantics.\n\n2. **New API v2 Endpoints** in CalComAPIService:\n   - `addGuests`\
      \ - POST /v2/bookings/:bookingUid/guests\n   - `updateLocation` - PATCH /v2/bookings/:bookingUid/location  \n   - `getRecordings`\
      \ - GET /v2/bookings/:bookingUid/recordings\n   - `getConferencingSessions` - GET /v2/bookings/:bookingUid/conferencing-sessions\n\
      \   - `getTranscripts` - GET /v2/bookings/:bookingUid/transcripts\n\n3. **Action Modals** - AddGuestsModal, EditLocationModal,\
      \ ViewRecordingsModal, MeetingSessionDetailsModal, MarkNoShowModal with appropriate UX (email validation, side-effect\
      \ notes, undo capability)\n\n4. **Request Reschedule** - Deep link approach that opens web app, since this is a server-driven\
      \ operation with complex side effects (emails, webhooks, calendar updates)\n\n5. **Safety Features** - Network status\
      \ hook for offline-aware mutations, proper auth error handling (401/403)\n\n### Updates since last revision\n\n**iOS\
      \ header menu action gating and reschedule wiring:**\n- iOS header menu now filters actions based on centralized gating\
      \ (same as booking list) - hides Mark No-Show for upcoming bookings, shows Reschedule only when enabled\n- Added `onActionsReady`\
      \ callback prop to `BookingDetailScreen` to expose internal action handlers (reschedule modal) to parent component\n\
      - iOS header menu reschedule action now properly triggers BookingDetailScreen's reschedule modal instead of showing\
      \ an alert\n- Uses ref-based"

    user_prompt: "Title: Fix admin impersonation performance and CSV export bugs\nState: open\nLines: +72/-5\nTime to first\
      \ review: 0.3 hours\n\nDescription:\n# Fixes #1931 \r\n\r\n## What\r\n\r\nTwo bugs when admins impersonate users with\
      \ lots of sales:\r\n\r\n**Performance issue**: Dashboard is super slow or times out completely when becoming a large\
      \ seller.\r\n\r\n**CSV export bug**: When you download sales data while impersonating someone, it could pull YOUR sales\
      \ instead of theirs.\r\n\r\nAffects users like `1265432` and `432151` - anyone with a ton of sales basically.\r\n\r\n\
      ## Why this happens\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\nThe `LargeSeller` table tracks users with 1000+ sales so we can cache\
      \ their analytics. Problem is, these records only get created when users visit their own analytics page (`analytics_controller.rb`\
      \ does this). The dashboard also uses `CreatorAnalytics::CachingProxy` but wasn't creating LargeSeller records.\r\n\r\
      \n**Fix**: Add `LargeSeller.create_if_warranted(current_seller)` to `dashboard_controller.rb` (same pattern as `analytics_controller.rb:15`)\
      \ + redirect impersonation to products page for faster initial load.\r\n\r\n### CSV exports\r\nThe issue is an edge\
      \ case with `current_seller`:\r\n\r\nWhen impersonating, `current_seller` uses cookie-based lookup with validation:\r\
      \n1. Cookie might have admin's seller ID from before impersonation\r\n2. `valid_seller?` checks `logged_in_user.member_of?(seller)`\r\
      \n3. If the impersonated user IS a team member of admin's account, this returns TRUE\r\n4. `current_seller` returns\
      \ admin's account instead of impersonated user\r\n\r\nThis edge case is rare but possible. Instead of relying on `current_seller`\
      \ during impersonation, we now explicitly use `logged_in_user` for exports.\r\n\r\n**Fix**: Add `seller_for_export`\
      \ method that returns `logged_in_user` when impersonating, bypassing the potentially-buggy `current_seller` logic.\r\
      \n\r\n## The fix\r\n\r\n**app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb**\r\n```ruby\r\ndef index\r\n  authorize :dashboard\r\
      \n\r\n  if current_seller.suspended_for_tos_violation?\r\n    redirect_to products_url\r\n  else\r\n    LargeSeller.create_if_warranted(current_seller)\
      \  # New - enables analytics caching\r\n    presenter"

    user_prompt: "Title: fix(mistralai): ensure JSON serialization for ToolMessage content\nState: open\nLines: +1/-1\nLabels:\
      \ integration, fix, mistralai\n\nDescription:\n---\n\n## **Fix: Serialize ToolMessage content for Mistral chat completions**\n\
      \n### **Problem**\n\nWhen using `langchain-mistralai` with MCP tools, tool outputs are propagated as `ToolMessage.content`.\n\
      For MCP servers, `message.content` is a **list of structured chunks** (e.g. `[{type: \"text\", text: \"...\", id: \"\
      ...\"}]`), not a plain string.\n\nThe Mistral Chat Completions API **strictly requires `tool.content` to be a string**.\n\
      Passing structured content results in a hard API failure:\n\n```\nHTTPStatusError: 422\nInput should be a valid string\n\
      ```\n\nThis happens even though:\n\n* The MCP tool itself returns valid output\n* LangChain correctly deserializes the\
      \ tool response\n* The failure occurs only at the Mistral API boundary\n\nThis is consistent with the documented limitation\
      \ that **Mistral does not support JSON / structured tool message content**.\n\n---\n\n### **Root Cause**\n\nIn `langchain-mistralai`,\
      \ `ToolMessage` objects are serialized as-is:\n\n```python\nif isinstance(message, ToolMessage):\n    return {\n   \
      \     \"role\": \"tool\",\n        \"content\": message.content,  # ❌ may be list[dict], not str\n        \"name\":\
      \ message.name,\n        \"tool_call_id\": ...\n    }\n```\n\nWhen `message.content` is a list of chunks, this violates\
      \ Mistral’s schema and triggers a 422 error.\n\n---\n\n### **Fix**\n\nForce serialization of tool message content into\
      \ a valid string before sending it to Mistral:\n\n```python\nif isinstance(message, ToolMessage):\n    return {\n  \
      \      \"role\": \"tool\",\n        \"content\": json.dumps(message.content, ensure_ascii=False),\n        \"name\"\
      : message.name,\n        \"tool_call_id\": ...\n    }\n```\n\nThis guarantees:\n\n* `tool.content` is always a string\n\
      * No schema violations at the API boundary\n* Compatibility with MCP tools and structured outputs\n\n---\n\n### **Why\
      \ this approach**\n\n* Matches Mistral API requirements exactly\n* Aligns with LangChain’s existing behavior for providers\
      \ without structured tool message support\n* Does **not** alter tool execution or MCP semantics\n* Keeps the fix narro"

      Cycle time: 13.9 hours\nTime to first review: 13.9 hours\n\nDescription:\n## Overview\r\n\r\nIn the current latest version\
      \ of Deno (2.6.3), there is an issue where running the `deno install` command causes patched packages specified in the\
      \ `links` property of `deno.json` to be overwritten with npm package sources. To reproduce this issue, first remove\
      \ all node_modules directories using a command like `rm -r node_modules **/node_modules`, then run `deno install`.\r\
      \n\r\nWith the following configuration, the files under `./patches/@deno/vite-plugin` are overwritten with the source\
      \ code from npm:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"links\": [\"./patches/@deno/vite-plugin\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis occurs\
      \ because patch files are cloned using hard links.\r\n\r\nPreviously, only `./patches/@deno/vite-plugin/package.json`\
      \ was being modified. This was because `clone_dir_recursive_except_node_modules_child` was calling `clone_dir_recursive`\
      \ instead of itself during recursion, resulting in simple copies rather than hard links. As a result, the overwriting\
      \ occurred silently and was difficult to notice. Since the intended behavior appears to be using hard links to allow\
      \ direct modifications to the original files, I have updated the function to call itself recursively.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,\
      \ we have added a regression test to check that files in the existing integrations tests (under `/tests/specs`) are\
      \ not overwritten. I added it by looking at other tests, but please let me know if there is a more desirable testing\
      \ method.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue\r\n\r\nI couldn't find it, but if it was there, I'm sorry."

      State: merged

      Cycle time: 5.6 hours

      Time to first review: 0.0 hours


      Description:

      ## What does this PR do?


      Fixes the embed-react package build to properly support Next.js App Router by adding a `"use client"` directive banner
      to the Rollup output.


      During bundling, the `"use client"` directive that exists in source files ends up in the middle of the bundled output,
      which Rollup ignores/removes since the directive only makes sense at the top of a file. This PR:


      1. Adds a `"use client"` banner to the top of the bundled output for proper client component support

      2. Suppresses the `MODULE_LEVEL_DIRECTIVE` warning that Rollup emits when it encounters `"use client"` mid-file (following
      the same approach as [vite-plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/3748fc7493cf0a07a2ae275fbd1ae035f01010cc/packages/plugin-react/src/index.ts#L307-L323))

      3. Suppresses the "Can''t resolve original location of error" warning that occurs due to the directive being ignored

      4. Adds the missing UMD global for `react/jsx-runtime`


      ## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)


      - [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).

      - [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs).
      N/A - build config change only.

      - [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.


      ## How should this be tested?


      1. Build the embed-react package: `yarn workspace @calcom/embed-react build`

      2. Verify the output bundle starts with `"use client";`

      3. Verify no MODULE_LEVEL_DIRECTIVE warnings appear during build


      ## Checklist


      - [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project

      - [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas

      - [x] I have checked if my changes generate no new warnings

      State: merged

      Lines: +0/-22

      Labels: core, foundation, ready-for-e2e, size/S

      Cycle time: 1.2 hours

      Time to first review: 0.1 hours


      Description:

      ## What does this PR do?


      Removes the buildjet cache from the `cache-build` GitHub Action and simplifies it to just run `yarn build`, relying
      on Turbo Remote Caching instead.


      **Root cause of the issue:** The buildjet cache was causing consistent cache misses because the `hashFiles()` function
      in `key-2` was producing different hashes between the build job and E2E shards. This happened because `yarn prisma generate`
      (run during `yarn-install`) generates `.ts` files in `packages/prisma/zod/` and `packages/kysely/` that are included
      in the hash pattern, and these generated files can differ slightly between runs.


      **Why this fix works:** Since Turbo Remote Caching is already configured and handles the `.next` and `dist` outputs
      (as defined in `turbo.json`), the buildjet cache is redundant and was causing more problems than it solved.


      ## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)


      - [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).

      - [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a documentation change.
      N/A - CI infrastructure change only.

      - [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works. N/A - This will
      be validated by observing CI behavior.


      ## How should this be tested?


      1. Merge this PR and observe a subsequent PR''s CI run

      2. Verify that E2E shards no longer show "Cache not found" for the prod-build cache

      3. Verify that Turbo Remote Caching is being used (look for "Remote cache hit" in build logs)

      4. Monitor build times to ensure they''re acceptable


      ## Human Review Checklist


      - [x] Verify Turbo Remote Caching is properly configured in CI (TURBO_TOKEN and TURBO_TEAM secrets are set)

      - [x] Note: `@calcom/embed-core#build` has `cache: false` in turbo.json, so embed files will rebuild each time (this
      was an accepted tradeoff)


      ## Checklist


      - [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project

      - [x] I have checked if my changes generate no'

      Hotfix: Yes\nTime to first review: 0.0 hours\n\nDescription:\n## Problem\r\n\r\nThe `verify_and_fix_flags_cache_task`\
      \ has been experiencing OOM kills. Investigation revealed that while the batch size reduction in #43961 was correct,\
      \ memory can accumulate between batches because Python's GC doesn't aggressively release memory to the OS. Additionally,\
      \ workers with high baseline memory from previous tasks have less headroom for this memory-intensive operation.\r\n\r\
      \n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Add `gc.collect()` at the start of verification to clear accumulated garbage from previous tasks,\
      \ maximizing available memory headroom\r\n- Add `gc.collect()` after each batch to prevent memory accumulation between\
      \ batches\r\n- Remove unnecessary `select_related(\"team\")` from the flags batch loading query since only `team_id`\
      \ is needed for grouping (Team objects are already loaded by the caller)\r\n\r\n## How did you test this code?\r\n\r\
      \n- Ran all 126 affected unit tests:\r\n  - `posthog/storage/test/test_hypercache_verifier.py` (43 tests)\r\n  - `posthog/models/feature_flag/test/test_flags_cache.py`\
      \ (75 tests)\r\n  - `posthog/tasks/test/test_hypercache_verification.py` (8 tests)\r\n- Verified with ruff that code\
      \ passes linting and formatting checks\r\n\r\nThese are conservative changes that reduce memory pressure without changing\
      \ verification behavior. Worker memory recycling configuration is being investigated separately as an infrastructure\
      \ change.\r\n"

      \n\r\nThe root cause is in `toUIMessageStream`'s handling of LangGraph `values` events. When a `values` event contains\
      \ the full message history (including AIMessages with `tool_calls` from previous turns), the adapter emits `tool-input-start`\
      \ and `tool-input-available` events for ALL historical tool calls, but does NOT emit corresponding `tool-output-available`\
      \ events for them.\r\n\r\nThis creates orphaned tool parts in the UIMessage with state `input-available` (no output).\
      \ When `toBaseMessages` converts these back for the next request, it creates AIMessages with `tool_calls` but no following\
      \ ToolMessages, causing the OpenAI API error.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nAdded a two-pass approach when processing `values`\
      \ events in `processLangGraphEvent`:\r\n\r\n1. **First pass**: Collect all tool call IDs that have been responded to\
      \ by ToolMessages in the message history. These are \"completed\" historical tool calls.\r\n\r\n2. **Second pass**:\
      \ When processing AIMessages with tool calls, skip emitting events for any tool call that exists in the completed set.\r\
      \n\r\nThis ensures that:\r\n- Historical tool calls that already have ToolMessage responses are NOT re-emitted\r\n-\
      \ Only new/current tool calls (those without ToolMessage responses yet) are emitted\r\n- The client's message history\
      \ remains consistent without orphaned tool parts\r\n\r\n## Manual Verification\r\n\r\nI double checked this resolution\
      \ using the provided reproduction case and was able to validate that all is working fine:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1624\"\

      \ by their `delegatedToId` before creating calendar services\n- Create ONE calendar service per delegation group (using\
      \ the first credential as representative)\n- Merge all selected calendars from credentials in the same group\n- Make\

      Draft: Yes


      Description:

      ## What does this PR do?


      Migrates the `@calcom/platform-libraries` package from Vite to tsup (esbuild-based) for library bundling. This addresses
      the complexity of the current Vite setup and removes the brittle `sed` hack that was required to fix lru-cache CJS/ESM
      module interop issues.


      **Changes:**

      - Replace Vite with tsup for bundling

      - Remove the `sed` workaround for lru-cache interop (`watch-lru-fix` and `build:dev` scripts)

      - Create `tsup.config.ts` with all 13 entry points, externals list, and path aliases

      - Maintain ESM + CJS dual output with TypeScript declarations

      **Requested by:** keith@cal.com (@keithwillcode)


      ## Updates since last revision


      Fixed Jest test failures caused by dynamic `import()` calls in the bundled CJS output:


      - **Split tsup config into separate ESM and CJS builds** - ESM uses `splitting: true` for code splitting, CJS uses `splitting:
      false` to convert dynamic imports to lazy initialization functions

      - **Bundle `@calcom/app-store`** - Added to `noExternal` to avoid JSON import issues when Jest loads app-store metadata
      files via ts-jest

      - **All 14 API v2 test suites now pass** (208 tests)


      The key insight: Vite converts dynamic `import()` to `Promise.resolve().then(() => require())` which works in CJS. By
      using `splitting: false` for CJS, esbuild does the same conversion.

      Draft: Yes


      Description:

      ## What does this PR do?


      This PR configures API v2 (NestJS) to use SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) instead of the default TypeScript compiler for faster
      build times. SWC is a Rust-based compiler that is ~20x faster than tsc and is officially supported by NestJS.


      Changes:

      - Added `@swc/cli` and `@swc/core` as dev dependencies

      - Created `.swcrc` configuration with `decoratorMetadata: true` (required for NestJS dependency injection)

      - Updated `nest-cli.json` to use `"builder": "swc"` with `"typeCheck": true` to ensure the swagger plugin continues
      to work


      This is Phase 1 of a potential migration away from the current Vite-based bundling setup for platform libraries.

      ## How should this be tested?


      1. Run `cd apps/api/v2 && yarn nest build` to verify SWC compilation works

      2. Start the API v2 server and verify it boots without errors

      3. Test a few API endpoints to ensure decorator-based dependency injection works correctly

      4. Verify swagger documentation is still generated correctly at `/api/v2/docs`


      **Note:** There are pre-existing type errors in `@calcom/trpc` package that cause the build to fail with `typeCheck:
      true`. These errors exist on the main branch as well and are unrelated to this PR. CI may need these fixed first, or
      `typeCheck` could be temporarily set to `false`.

    user_prompt: 'Title: fix: compose CalendarCacheWrapper with CalendarBatchWrapper for proper batching

      State: open

      Lines: +37/-15

      Labels: size/M

      Draft: Yes


      Description:

      ## What does this PR do?


      Previously, `CalendarCacheWrapper` and `CalendarBatchWrapper` were mutually exclusive - when cache was enabled, the
      batch wrapper was bypassed entirely. This caused uncached calendars to skip the batching logic, resulting in multiple
      freebusy API calls per `delegationCredential` instead of one consolidated call.


      This PR changes the wrapper composition so that:

      - If cache is enabled AND batch is supported: `CalendarCacheWrapper(CalendarBatchWrapper(originalCalendar))`

      - If cache is enabled but batch is not supported: `CalendarCacheWrapper(originalCalendar)`

      - If cache is not enabled but batch is supported: `CalendarBatchWrapper(originalCalendar)`

      - Otherwise: `originalCalendar`


      This ensures that when `CalendarCacheWrapper` passes uncached calendars to its underlying calendar, they are still properly
      batched by `delegationCredentialId` via `CalendarBatchWrapper`.


      ## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)


      - [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).

      - [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs).
      N/A - internal implementation change only.

      - [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.


      ## How should this be tested?


      1. Enable both calendar cache and batch features for a Google Calendar credential with delegation

      2. Have some calendars with sync enabled (cached) and some without (uncached)

      3. Request availability for multiple calendars sharing the same `delegationCredentialId`

      4. Verify in logs that uncached calendars are batched together per `delegationCredentialId` instead of making separate
      freebusy calls


      **Expected behavior:** When both cache and batch are supported, the logs should show:

      - "Calendar Batch is supported, wrapping with CalendarBatchWrapper"

      - "Calendar Cache is enabled, wrapping with CalendarCacheWrapper" with `hasBatchWrapper: true`

      ## What does this PR do?\n\nRefactors the CI workflow to create a dedicated `setup-db` job that runs before all E2E\
      \ and integration test jobs, eliminating a potential race condition in database cache creation.\n\n**Problem:** Previously,\
      \ `build-api-v1` was the first job that ran the `cache-db` action to create the database cache. However, several E2E\
      \ jobs (`e2e-api-v2`, `e2e-app-store`, `e2e-embed`, `e2e-embed-react`) didn't depend on `build-api-v1`, so they could\
      \ potentially run `cache-db` simultaneously, causing a race condition where multiple jobs might try to write to the\
      \ same cache.\n\n**Solution:** \n- Create a new `setup-db.yml` workflow with only the env vars needed for database seeding:\n\
      \  - `CALENDSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL` (core DB setup)\n  - `E2E_TEST_CALCOM_QA_EMAIL`,\
      \ `E2E_TEST_CALCOM_QA_PASSWORD`, `E2E_TEST_CALCOM_QA_GCAL_CREDENTIALS` (QA user seeding)\n  - `GOOGLE_API_CREDENTIALS`\
      \ (google-calendar app keys seeding)\n  - `TURBO_TOKEN`, `TURBO_TEAM` (turbo caching)\n- Add `setup-db` job to `pr.yml`\
      \ that runs before all E2E jobs\n- Update all E2E and integration test jobs to depend on `setup-db`\n- Update `build-api-v1`\
      \ to depend on `setup-db` (it still has its own postgres service and cache-db action, which will get a cache hit)\n\n\
      ### Updates since last revision\n\n- **Fixed cache key invalidation in reusable workflows:** The `cache-db` action now\
      \ accepts a `COMMIT_SHA` input and uses a fallback chain (`inputs.COMMIT_SHA || github.event.pull_request.head.sha ||\
      \ github.sha`). This fixes an issue where `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` was empty in `workflow_call` contexts,\
      \ causing the cache to not invalidate on new commits.\n- **Added `GOOGLE_API_CREDENTIALS`:** Required by `seed-app-store.ts`\
      \ to populate the google-calendar app keys in the database. Without this, the E2E API v2 tests for Google Calendar OAuth\
      \ endpoints would fail with 400 Bad Request due to null app keys.\n\n## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)\n\n- [x] I have\

      Labels: ai/provider\n\nDescription:\n## Background\r\n\r\nAdd support for setting mediaResolution on individual file\
      \ parts via providerOptions, enabling fine-grained control over token usage for media inputs.\r\n\r\nThis is a Gemini\
      \ 3 exclusive feature at the moment, it allows mixing different resolution levels in a single request (e.g., high resolution\
      \ for complex diagrams, low for simple images).\r\n\r\nSee: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/media-resolution#per-part-media-resolution\r\
      \n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n- Add GoogleGenerativeAIFilePartProviderOptions schema with mediaResolution enum (including\
      \ MEDIA_RESOLUTION_ULTRA_HIGH which is only available per-part)\r\n- Update message conversion to extract and apply\
      \ per-part mediaResolution from providerOptions\r\n- Add warning when per-part mediaResolution is used with non-Gemini\
      \ 3 models\r\n- Export new type from package index\r\n- Add comprehensive tests for the new functionality\r\n\r\nThe\
      \ implementation is backward compatible - mediaResolution is only added to parts when explicitly specified, so older\
      \ models are unaffected.\r\n\r\n## Manual Verification\r\n\r\nVerified using the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const\

      Lines: +160/-74\nLabels: release\nTime to first review: 0.0 hours\n\nDescription:\n## Summary\n\nFixes a race condition\
      \ where `onSurveysLoaded` callbacks received an empty array on first page load.\n\n**The bug:** `generateSurveys` starts\
      \ an async fetch, and when `onSurveysLoaded` callbacks tried to call `getSurveys`, it immediately returned an empty\
      \ array with error \"Surveys are already being loaded\" due to concurrent fetch protection.\n\n**The fix:** Instead\
      \ of returning an error when a fetch is in progress, we now track the in-flight request with a Promise. Multiple callers\
      \ share the same Promise and all receive the result when it completes.\n\n```typescript\n// Before: immediately returned\
      \ error when fetch in progress\nif (this._isFetchingSurveys) {\n    return callback([], {\n        isLoaded: false,\n\
      \        error: 'Surveys are already being loaded',\n    })\n}\n\n// After: callers subscribe to the in-flight Promise\n\
      if (this._getSurveysInFlightPromise) {\n    this._getSurveysInFlightPromise.then(({ surveys, context }) => callback(surveys,\
      \ context))\n    return\n}\n```\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Added regression test for the race condition\n- [x] Added unit\
      \ tests for Promise reuse behavior  \n- [x] All existing survey tests pass"

    user_prompt: "Title: fix(flags): Prevent OOM in flags cache verification task\nState: merged\nLines: +51/-24\nCycle time:\
      \ 0.8 hours\nTime to first review: 0.0 hours\n\nDescription:\n## Problem\r\n\r\nThe flags cache verification task was\
      \ experiencing two issues causing it to fail ~50% of scheduled runs:\r\n\r\n1. **OOM kills**: The task loads both cached\
      \ data (from Redis) and DB data (FeatureFlag objects with large `filters` JSON) into memory simultaneously. With 1000\
      \ teams per batch, some batches containing \"power user\" teams with 100+ flags caused memory spikes of 100-200MB, triggering\
      \ OOM kills.\r\n\r\n2. **Stale locks after crashes**: When pods are killed (OOM or deploy), the `finally` block never\
      \ runs, leaving a stale distributed lock for the full 1-hour timeout. This caused the next scheduled run to skip, resulting\
      \ in 2 hours of lost verification after each crash.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n**Batch size reduction (flags only):**\r\
      \n- Reduce flags cache verification batch size from 1000 to 250 teams\r\n- Keep team metadata verification at 1000 (lighter\
      \ data, no OOM issues)\r\n- Add separate Django settings for each cache type's chunk size\r\n\r\n**Scheduling improvements:**\r\
      \n- Run flags verification every 30 min instead of hourly\r\n- Reduce lock timeout from 60 to 25 min for faster crash\
      \ recovery\r\n- Reduce task time limits from 45/60 to 20/25 min (soft/hard)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior after changes:**\r\
      \n\r\n| Metric | Before | After |\r\n|--------|--------|-------|\r\n| Flags batch size | 1000 | 250 |\r\n| Memory per\
      \ batch | 100-200MB | 25-50MB |\r\n| Task duration | ~3-5 min (but OOM'd) | ~8-10 min |\r\n| Runs per hour | 1 | 2 |\r\
      \n| Recovery after crash | 2 hours | ~30 min |\r\n\r\n## How did you test this code?\r\n\r\n- Ran existing unit tests\
      \ for hypercache verification tasks\r\n- Analyzed production data to understand flag distribution across teams\r\n-\
      \ Verified batch size reduction prevents memory amplification from heavy teams\r\n\r\nQuery results showed oldest teams\
      \ (IDs 0-999) average 27.4 flags vs 4.1 for newer teams, and the first batch with ID ordering contained 6-14x more flags\
      \ than subsequent batches.\r\n\r\n## Changelog: (features only) Is this feature complete?\r\n\r\nNo - this is a reliability\
      \ fix"
