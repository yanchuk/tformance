    "vars": {
      "pr_body": "## What does this PR do?\n\nRemoves the buildjet cache from the `cache-build` GitHub Action and simplifies it to just run `yarn build`, relying on Turbo Remote Caching instead.\n\n**Root cause of the issue:** The buildjet cache was causing consistent cache misses because the `hashFiles()` function in `key-2` was producing different hashes between the build job and E2E shards. This happened because `yarn prisma generate` (run during `yarn-install`) generates `.ts` files in `packages/prisma/zod/` and `packages/kysely/` that are included in the hash pattern, and these generated files can differ slightly between runs.\n\n**Why this fix works:** Since Turbo Remote Caching is already configured and handles the `.next` and `dist` outputs (as defined in `turbo.json`), the buildjet cache is redundant and was causing more problems than it solved.\n\n## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)\n\n- [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).\n- [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a documentation change. N/A - CI infrastructure change only.\n- [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works. N/A - This will be validated by observing CI behavior.\n\n## How should this be tested?\n\n1. Merge this PR and observe a subsequent PR's CI run\n2. Verify that E2E shards no longer show \"Cache not found\" for the prod-build cache\n3. Verify that Turbo Remote Caching is being used (look for \"Remote cache hit\" in build logs)\n4. Monitor build times to ensure they're acceptable\n\n## Human Review Checklist\n\n- [x] Verify Turbo Remote Caching is properly configured in CI (TURBO_TOKEN and TURBO_TEAM secrets are set)\n- [x] Note: `@calcom/embed-core#build` has `cache: false` in turbo.json, so embed files will rebuild each time (this was an accepted tradeoff)\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project\n- [x] I have checked if my changes generate no new warnings\n\n## Updates since last revision\n\n- Preserved the original action name and description per reviewer feedback\n\n---\n\nLink to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/31be59cfbeb2411394ffac161d191049\nRequested by: keith@cal.com (@keithwillcode)"

      "pr_body": "\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes two specific issues preventing the `@calcom/web` app from building successfully on Windows environments:\r\n\r\n1.  **Invalid Path Separators in Rewrite Logic**:\r\n\r\n    - In `apps/web/pagesAndRewritePaths.ts`, `globSync` returns paths with backslashes (`\\`) on Windows.\r\n    - These paths are used to construct a Regex for excluded routes. Backslashes in the regex string were causing \"Invalid route source\" errors or matching failures because they were interpreted as escape characters or literal backslashes rather than path separators.\r\n    - **Fix**: Normalized all file paths to use forward slashes (`/`) regardless of the OS.\r\n\r\n2.  **Invalid Source Pattern in `next.config.ts`**:\r\n    - The `sprite.svg` route configuration included a query string matcher `(\\\\?v=[0-9a-zA-Z\\\\-\\\\.]+)?`.\r\n    - Next.js `rewrites` and `headers` `source` fields **do not support query strings**. Including them causes \"Invalid headers found\" or route parsing errors.\r\n    - **Fix**: Simplified the source to `/icons/sprite.svg`.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n- **Local Build (Windows)**: Ran `npm run build` in `apps/web`. Confirmed that the build process now passes the configuration parsing and route generation stages where it previously failed immediately.\r\n- **Note**: The build is memory intensive. It is recommended to use `NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max-old-space-size=8192\"` if encountering OOM errors.\r\n"

    "vars": {
      "pr_body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nExperiment metrics are stored in arrays (`metrics`, `metrics_secondary`, `saved_metrics`) while their display order is tracked separately in ordering arrays (`primary_metrics_ordered_uuids`, `secondary_metrics_ordered_uuids`).\r\n\r\nWhen adding or removing metrics, the frontend has to update both the metrics array AND the ordering array. This coupling causes bugs/race conditions where metrics are added but their UUIDs wouldn't appear in the ordering array.\r\n\r\nThis is also problematic for API callers (i.e. MCP) who don't know about the ordering arrays.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Backend now automatically syncs ordering arrays when metrics change\r\n- Frontend no longer manages ordering arrays when adding/removing metrics\r\n- The explicit \"reorder metrics\" feature still works - it sends only the ordering arrays without metrics.\r\n\r\n**Caveats:**\r\n- One tradeoff I'm going for is that duplication will add a metric at the end of the main array list (e.g. `metrics_secondary`) as opposed to right after the original metric. Making this mimic the current functionality will require some more code in the backend (e.g. look up original metric by UUID and then place it behind it). I might add this later if we get complaints.\r\n- In the create form, we're no longer rendering from the ordering arrays (since we don't want to touch those arrays in the frontend), so the saved metrics will appear _after_ the main metrics, regardless of the insertion order.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests for ordering sync.\r\n\r\nManual testing checklist:\r\n\r\n**Update flow - inline metrics:**\r\n- [x] Add a primary metric without sending ordering \u2192 UUID appears in ordering\r\n- [x] Add a secondary metric without sending ordering \u2192 UUID appears in ordering\r\n- [x] Remove a metric \u2192 UUID removed from ordering\r\n- [x] Update only experiment name \u2192 ordering unchanged\r\n\r\n**Update flow - saved metrics:**\r\n- [x] Add a saved metric without sending ordering \u2192 UUID appears in ordering\r\n- [x] Remove a saved metric \u2192 UUID removed from ordering\r\n\r\n**Create flow:**\r\n- [x] Create experiment with inline metrics \u2192 ordering auto-populated\r\n- [x] Create experiment with saved metrics \u2192 ordering auto-populated\r\n\r\n**Edge cases:**\r\n- [x] Duplicate a metric \u2192 new metric appears (at end of list)\r\n- [x] Explicit reorder still works (drag and drop in UI)\r\n"

      "pr_body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds comprehensive documentation for `init_chat_model`, making it easy to understand, hard to misuse, and well-documented for real-world usage.\r\n\r\n### \ud83c\udfaf What This PR Delivers\r\n\r\n**New Documentation**: `libs/langchain_v1/INIT_CHAT_MODEL_GUIDE.md` (694 lines)\r\n\r\nThis is a natural continuation of my previous merged PR that added validation logic to `init_chat_model`. Now, users have clear guidance on how to use it effectively.\r\n\r\n### \u2705 What's Included\r\n\r\n#### 1. Clear Explanation\r\n- What `init_chat_model` is\r\n- Why it exists (solves provider fragmentation)\r\n- When to use it vs provider-specific classes\r\n\r\n#### 2. Working Code Examples\r\nSeven complete, tested examples covering:\r\n- Fixed models\r\n- Provider-agnostic tools\r\n- Runtime configurable models\r\n- Multiple models with prefixes\r\n- Tool binding (function calling)\r\n- Streaming and batching\r\n\r\nAll examples are copy-paste ready and follow best practices.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Common Mistakes & Error Explanations\r\nDocumented 7 common mistakes with:\r\n- \u274c What's wrong (with code example)\r\n- \u2705 How to fix it (with corrected code)\r\n- \ud83d\udca1 Why validation errors exist\r\n\r\nThis directly connects to the validation logic from my previous PR and helps users understand error messages.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Design Rationale\r\nExplains:\r\n- Why validation & inference are centralized\r\n- How it improves consistency across providers\r\n- System-level tradeoffs\r\n- When centralized approach makes sense\r\n\r\nShows understanding of architectural decisions and long-term maintainability.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udcc1 Files Changed\r\n\r\n- **`libs/langchain_v1/INIT_CHAT_MODEL_GUIDE.md`** (new): Complete usage guide\r\n- **`libs/langchain_v1/README.md`** (modified): Added link to guide\r\n\r\n### \ud83c\udfaf Target Audience\r\n\r\nThis documentation helps:\r\n1. **New users** quickly understand how to initialize models\r\n2. **Experienced users** learn runtime configuration patterns\r\n3. **Multi-provider app developers** build flexible systems\r\n4. **Everyone** avoid common pitfalls\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udd04 Connection to Previous Work\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on my previous merged contribution that added validation logic. Now users understand:\r\n- Why validation exists\r\n- What errors mean\r\n- How to fix common mistakes\r\n\r\n### \u2705 Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Comprehensive \"What/Why/When\" explanation\r\n- [x] 7 working code examples\r\n- [x] Common mistakes documented with fixes\r\n- [x] Design rationale included\r\n- [x] README updated with guide link\r\n- [x] All examples follow LangChain coding standards\r\n- [x] Markdown formatting validated\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udcdd Notes\r\n\r\n- This documentation can be later adapted for the separate `docs` repository\r\n- Examples tested with latest LangChain version\r\n- Follows Google-style documentation patterns from `AGENTS.md`\r\n\r\n---"

N/A - no documentation changes needed.\n- [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works. N/A - configuration changes only, CI will validate.\n\n## How should this be tested?\n\n1. Verify CI passes for both apps (production builds, type check, lint)\n2. For api/v1: Confirm the API still responds correctly (the proxy.ts file blocks internal route segments like `/_get`, `/_post`, etc.)\n3. For the example app: Confirm it builds and runs with `yarn dev` in `packages/platform/examples/base`\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project\n- [x] I have checked if my changes generate no new warnings\n\n## Human Review Checklist\n\n- [ ] Verify the `middleware.ts` \u2192 `proxy.ts` rename follows Next.js 16 migration correctly\n- [ ] Confirm the example app (jumping from 14.2.35 \u2192 16.1.0) doesn't need additional migration steps\n- [ ] Verify turbopack config is appropriate for both apps\n- [ ] Confirm the yarn.lock cleanup only removed unused dependencies\n\n---\n\nLink to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/a978ce6e4cef4072857d00ca31fe3b68\nRequested by: Volnei Munhoz (@volnei)"

To test, you can call the `viewer.admin.listTeams` endpoint with various parameters.\n- **Expected (happy path):**\n    - Calling the endpoint with `limit` and `offset` should return paginated team data.\n    - Adding `searchTerm` should filter teams by name or slug.\n    - Applying `filters` for `id`, `name`, `slug`, `organizationId`, `organizationSlug`, `owner`, `subscriptionId`, or `kind` should correctly filter the results.\n    - Providing `sorting` parameters should order the results as expected.\n    - The returned `rows` should contain `id`, `name`, `slug`, `isOrganization`, `organization`, `owner`, `subscriptionId`, and `createdAt` fields.\n- **Minimal test data:** Ensure you have multiple teams in your database, some with owners, some belonging to organizations, and some with associated subscriptions to fully test all filter and data display capabilities.\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [ ] I haven't read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [ ] My code doesn't follow the style guidelines of this project\n- [ ] I haven't commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\n- [ ] I haven't checked if my changes generate no new warnings\n\n---\n<a href=\"https://cursor.com/background-agent?bcId=bc-24a37f17-6075-4d1b-bf11-df3688c477f6\"><picture><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor-dark.svg\"><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor-light.svg\"><img alt=\"Open in Cursor\" src=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor.svg\"></picture></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cursor.com/agents?id=bc-24a37f17-6075-4d1b-bf11-df3688c477f6\"><picture><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web-dark.svg\"><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web-light.svg\"><img alt=\"Open in Web\" src=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web.svg\"></picture></a>\n\n"

    "vars": {
      "pr_body": "## Description\r\nThis PR fixes a critical crash that occurs on self-hosted instances or local development environments where the `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY` is not defined.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the application would crash on startup or when accessing billing-related pages because the Stripe module attempted to initialize immediately with an undefined key.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- **Refactor:** Updated `StripeService` to lazy-load the Stripe client only when requested, rather than at import time.\r\n- **Fix:** Updated `StripeClient.ts` (DI module) to safely handle a missing API key. Instead of throwing an error, it now logs a warning and returns a dummy object, allowing the server to start and run non-billing features.\r\n- **Refactor:** Updated consumers (e.g., `TeamBillingServiceFactory`, `webhook.ts`) to use the new lazy-loading pattern.\r\n\r\n## How to Test\r\n1. Ensure `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY` is missing or commented out in the `.env` file.\r\n2. Run `yarn dev`.\r\n3. Verify the server starts successfully without the \"STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY is missing\" crash.\r\n4. Navigate to `/settings/teams/new` (or click \"Create a new team\").\r\n5. Verify the page loads successfully (previously caused a runtime crash)."

But in truth, it feels unacceptable to have an outdated changelog for so long. Because of that, I've been entertaining the idea of auto generating it for a really long time and finally have come to it.\r\n\r\nThis generates it from the CHANGELOG.md file for each package we have. It then parses the markdown files there in a very simple way to determine the versions for each log and the changes themselves. It then, using `git blame` and the line of the version's header (i.e., `## x.x.x`) to determine the date of that version. Finally, it then groups those logs based on the date formatted as `[Month] [Date], [Year]`, sorts and then outputs using the [Mintlify's Update component](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/components/update).\r\n\r\nWith those changes, the changelog (now updated automatically), looks like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2262\" height=\"1206\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a2a9465-1f3e-4da3-8aee-4e81aa444a25\" />\r\n\r\nThe single problem with this right now is that it rewrites the entire changelog, since it's also a different structure, which removes the changelog entries we had before we started using changesets."

When you're ready to do a release, you can merge this and the packages will be published to npm automatically. If you're not ready to do a release yet, that's fine, whenever you add more changesets to main, this PR will be updated.\n\n\n# Releases\n## @trigger.dev/build@4.1.1\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n-   The `prismaExtension` has been completely redesigned to support multiple Prisma versions and deployment strategies. This update introduces **three distinct modes** to handle the evolving Prisma ecosystem, from legacy setups to the upcoming Prisma 7. ([#2689](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/pull/2689))\n\n    **Highlights:**\n\n    -   \ud83c\udfaf Three modes: Legacy, Engine-Only, and Modern\n    -   \ud83c\udf89 **NEW:** Support for `prisma.config.ts` files (Legacy Mode)\n    -   \ud83d\udd0d **NEW:** Enhanced version detection with filesystem fallback\n\n    ## Breaking Changes\n\n    \u26a0\ufe0f **MIGRATION REQUIRED**: The `prismaExtension` now requires an explicit `mode` parameter. Existing configurations without a `mode` will need to be updated.\n\n    **Note:** All other existing options remain backward compatible. The new `configFile` option is optional and doesn't affect existing setups using the `schema` option.\n\n    ### Before (Old API)\n\n    ```ts\n    import { prismaExtension } from \"@trigger.dev/build/extensions/prisma\";\n\n    extensions: [\n      prismaExtension({\n        schema: \"prisma/schema.prisma\",\n        migrate: true,\n        typedSql: true,\n        directUrlEnvVarName: \"DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED\",\n      }),\n    ];\n    ```\n\n    ### After (New API)\n\n    ```ts\n    import { prismaExtension } from \"@trigger.dev/build/extensions/prisma\";\n\n    extensions: [\n      prismaExtension({\n        mode: \"legacy\", // \u2190 MODE IS NOW REQUIRED\n        schema: \"prisma/schema.prisma\",\n        migrate: true,\n        typedSql: true,\n        directUrlEnvVarName: \"DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED\",\n      }),\n    ];\n    ```\n\n    ## New Features\n\n    ### 1. Legacy Mode\n\n    **Use when:** You're using Prisma 6.x or earlier with the `prisma-client-js` provider.\n\n    **Features:**\n\n    -   Automatic `prisma generate` during deployment\n    -   Supports single-file schemas (`prisma/schema.prisma`)\n    -   Supports multi-file schemas (Prisma 6.7+, directory-based schemas)\n    -   **NEW:** Supports Prisma config files (`prisma.config.ts`) via `@prisma/config` package\n    -   Migration support with `migrate: true`\n    -   TypedSQL support with `typedSql: true`\n    -   Custom generator selection\n    -   Handles Prisma client versioning automatically (with filesystem fallback detection)\n    -   Automatic extraction of schema and migrations paths from config files\n\n    **Schema Configuration:**\n\n    ```prisma\n    generator client {\n      provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\n      previewFeatures = [\"typedSql\"]\n    }\n\n    datasource db {\n      provider  = \"postgresql\"\n      url       = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n      directUrl = env(\"DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED\")\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Extension Configuration:**\n\n    ```ts\n    // Single-file schema\n    prismaExtension({\n      mode: \"legacy\",\n      schema: \"prisma/schema.prisma\",\n      migrate: true,\n      typedSql: true,\n      directUrlEnvVarName: \"DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED\",\n    });\n\n    // Multi-file schema (Prisma 6.7+)\n    prismaExtension({\n      mode: \"legacy\",\n      schema: \"./prisma\", // \u2190 Point to directory\n      migrate: true,\n      typedSql: true,\n      directUrlEnvVarName: \"DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED\",\n    });\n    ```\n\n    **Tested Versions:**\n\n    -   Prisma 6.14.0 \u2705\n    -   Prisma 6.7.0+ (multi-file schema support) \u2705\n    -   Prisma 5.x \u2705\n\n    * * *\n\n    ### 2. Engine-Only Mode\n\n    **Use when:** You have a custom Prisma client output path and want to manage `prisma generate` yourself.\n\n    **Features:**\n\n    -   Only installs Prisma engine binaries (no client generation)\n    -   Automatic version detection from `@prisma/client`\n    -   Manual override of version and binary "

    "vars": {
      "pr_body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nFixes two **MEDIUM** priority bugs affecting SDK functionality.\r\n\r\n### 1. Tool Runner Cache Invalidation Bug\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n`BaseToolRunner.set_messages_params()` promises to \"invalidate any cached tool responses\" in its docstring, but never actually cleared `_cached_tool_call_response`. This caused:\r\n- Stale cached blocks reused after parameter mutations\r\n- 400 errors and runaway loops with wrong `tool_use_id`\r\n- Message duplication when `_messages_modified` flag wasn't set\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\n- Clear `_cached_tool_call_response = None` when params change\r\n- Set `_messages_modified = True` to prevent message duplication\r\n\r\n### 2. Bedrock HTTP/2 KeyError\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n`get_auth_headers()` unconditionally executed `del headers[\"connection\"]`:\r\n- HTTP/2 requests don't have a Connection header (HTTP/1.x only)\r\n- HTTPX defaults to HTTP/2 where available\r\n- Caused KeyError, preventing SigV4 signing from running\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\n- Use `headers.pop(\"connection\", None)` for safe removal\r\n- Works with both HTTP/1.1 (removes header) and HTTP/2 (no-op)\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### Cache Invalidation\r\n- **Issue Location**: `src/anthropic/lib/tools/_beta_runner.py:79-92`\r\n- **Root Cause**: Method updated `_params` but never cleared cached tool responses\r\n- **Fix**: Added two lines:\r\n  - `self._cached_tool_call_response = None` - clears cached tool response\r\n  - `self._messages_modified = True` - prevents message duplication in loops\r\n\r\n### HTTP/2 Compatibility\r\n- **Issue Location**: `src/anthropic/lib/bedrock/_auth.py:56-61`\r\n- **Root Cause**: `del headers[\"connection\"]` assumes header exists\r\n- **Fix**: Changed to `headers.pop(\"connection\", None)`\r\n- **Safety**: Works with `httpx.Headers` (case-insensitive) and plain dicts\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- \u2705 Cache invalidation is complete (both cache and flag cleared)\r\n- \u2705 HTTP/2 compatibility fix uses best approach\r\n- \u2705 No message duplication edge cases\r\n- \u2705 Safe header removal across HTTP versions\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- `src/anthropic/lib/tools/_beta_runner.py:91-92`\r\n  - Added `self._cached_tool_call_response = None`\r\n  - Added `self._messages_modified = True`\r\n- `src/anthropic/lib/bedrock/_auth.py:61`\r\n  - Changed `del headers[\"connection\"]` to `headers.pop(\"connection\", None)`\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- **Tool Runner**: Fixes 400 errors and runaway loops when mutating parameters\r\n- **Bedrock Client**: Enables HTTP/2 requests for AWS Bedrock integration\r\n- **Backwards Compatibility**: Fully maintained, no breaking changes"

    "vars": {
      "pr_body": "This PR introduces an upgraded Realtime streams backend and SDK that makes streams more reliable (and resumable) with increased or the removal of limits. We've also improved the visibily of streams via the run dashboard.\r\n\r\n## New limits\r\n\r\nView the below limits table for more details:\r\n\r\n| Limit                            | Streams v1 | Streams v2 |\r\n| -------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |\r\n| Maximum stream length            | 2000       | Unlimited  |\r\n| Number of active streams per run | 5          | Unlimited  |\r\n| Maximum streams per run          | 10         | Unlimited  |\r\n| Maximum stream TTL               | 1 day      | 28 days    |\r\n| Maximum stream size              | 10MB       | 300 MiB    |\r\n\r\nAdditionally, previously only a single client stream could be sent to a Realtime stream. Now, you can send multiple client streams to a single Realtime stream.\r\n\r\n## Reliability improvements\r\n\r\nWhen appending to a stream, the backend will now reliably resume appending from the last chunk index if there is a lost connection. Additionally, we've improved the reliability of reading from a stream by automatically resuming failed reads from the last chunk index if there is a lost connection.\r\n\r\nThis means that both sides of the stream will be much more reliable and will not lose data even when faced with network issues or other disruptions.\r\n\r\n## SDK improvements\r\n\r\nWe've moved the stream logic into their own dedicated namespace in the SDK instead of being mixed in with the other metadata methods:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { streams, metadata, task } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\";\r\n\r\nconst myTask = task({\r\n  id: \"my-task\",\r\n  run: async (payload: { message: string }) => {\r\n    const stream = // ... get a stream from somewhere\r\n      // Before:\r\n      await metadata.stream(\"my-stream\", stream);\r\n\r\n    // After: (notice we don't await the result)\r\n    streams.pipe(\"my-stream\", stream);\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now pipe to a stream using the `streams.pipe` method, which returns a result that can be used to wait until the stream is complete:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { streams, task } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\";\r\n\r\nconst myTask = task({\r\n  id: \"my-task\",\r\n  run: async (payload: { message: string }) => {\r\n    const myAIStream = // ... get a stream from somewhere\r\n\r\n    const { stream, waitUntilComplete } = streams.pipe(\"ai-stream\", myAIStream);\r\n\r\n    // A. Iterate over the stream which is an async iterable and a ReadableStream\r\n    for await (const chunk of stream) {\r\n      console.log(chunk);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // B. Wait until the stream is complete\r\n    await waitUntilComplete();\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      message: \"Stream completed successfully\",\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen calling `streams.pipe` from inside a task, the stream is automatically associated with the current run. You can also optionally specify a target run ID to pipe to a stream on a different run:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { streams, task } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\";\r\n\r\nconst myTask = task({\r\n  id: \"my-task\",\r\n  run: async (payload: { message: string; otherRunId?: string }, { ctx }) => {\r\n    const myAIStream = // ... get a stream from somewhere\r\n\r\n    // Pipe to a stream on the root run\r\n    const { stream, waitUntilComplete } = streams.pipe(\"ai-stream\", myAIStream, { target: ctx.run.rootTaskRunId });\r\n\r\n    // Pipe to a stream on the parent run\r\n    const { stream, waitUntilComplete } = streams.pipe(\"ai-stream\", myAIStream, { target: ctx.run.parentTaskRunId });\r\n\r\n    // Pipe to a stream on another run by ID\r\n    const { stream, waitUntilComplete } = streams.pipe(\"ai-stream\", myAIStream, { target: payload.otherRunId });\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that, if you specify a target run ID, you can pipe to a stream outside of a task:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { streams } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\";\r\nimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\r\nimport {\r\n  convertToModelMessages,\r\n  streamText,\r\n  UIMessage,\r\n  createUIMessageStreamResponse,\r\n} from \"ai\";\r\n\r\n// Allow streaming responses up to 30 sec"

The FIXME comment noted \"why not just add(u32)? This is hard to use.\"\r\n\r\n  This change makes the API more flexible by allowing callers to specify exactly how much to advance, making the      \r\n  intent clearer at call sites.\r\n"

      "pr_body": "Fixes #1058 \r\n\r\n# Update chat auth to allow anonymous sessions with matching sessionId\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nUpdated authentication logic across chat endpoints to use OR instead of AND logic. Previously, anonymous sessions were blocked from accessing conversations that had an `emailFrom` set. Now, access is granted if either:\r\n- The session has a matching `anonymousSessionId` (for anonymous sessions)\r\n- The session has a matching email address (for authenticated sessions)\r\n\r\nThis change affects 3 endpoints:\r\n- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Main chat endpoint\r\n- `app/api/chat/conversation/[slug]/message/[id]/route.ts` - Message reactions\r\n- `app/api/chat/conversation/[slug]/message/[id]/event/route.ts` - Message events\r\n\r\nThe new logic follows the same pattern already used in `app/api/chat/customerFilter.ts`.\r\n\r\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\r\n- [ ] **Security review**: Verify the OR logic doesn't grant unintended access to conversations\r\n- [ ] **End-to-end testing**: Test with both anonymous and authenticated sessions to ensure proper access control\r\n- [ ] **Edge case testing**: Test scenarios with missing `anonymousSessionId` or `emailFrom` values\r\n- [ ] **Requirements alignment**: Confirm the change matches the original request to allow anonymous sessions with correct sessionId\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThis is a critical authentication change that should be thoroughly tested before deployment. The logic change allows anonymous users to continue accessing conversations even after they provide their email address, as long as they have the correct `anonymousSessionId`.\r\n\r\nLink to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/686cb024beba4e4682568ce9c307835c\r\nRequested by: reason.koan@gmail.com"
