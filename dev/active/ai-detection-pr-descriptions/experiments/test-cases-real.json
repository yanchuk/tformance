        "pr_body": "## What does this PR do?\n\nFixes the E2E Report workflow's `workflow_dispatch` mode failing with \"No runs found with blob-report artifacts\" when manually triggered.\n\n**Root cause**: The workflow was searching for runs matching the PR's current `head_sha`, which fails when:\n1. The PR was updated after E2E tests ran (artifacts exist for an older commit SHA)\n2. The current run for that SHA is still queued/in-progress\n\n**Fix**: Search by `branch` instead of `head_sha`, and filter for `status: 'completed'` runs only.\n\n## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)\n\n- [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).\n- [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). N/A - CI workflow change only.\n- [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.\n\n## How should this be tested?\n\n1. Find a PR that has E2E test results from a previous commit (not the current head SHA)\n2. Go to Actions \u2192 \"E2E Report\" \u2192 \"Run workflow\"\n3. Enter the PR number\n4. Verify the workflow finds the blob-report artifacts and publishes the report\n\n## Human Review Checklist\n\n- [ ] Verify branch-based search is acceptable (could theoretically match wrong run if fork PRs have same branch name, but this is rare)\n- [ ] Confirm `status: 'completed'` filter correctly excludes queued/in-progress runs\n\n---\n\nLink to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/4f639bb6992f47a3bb1ba13cb11117c5\nRequested by: keith@cal.com (@keithwillcode)"

      "description": "[Cal.com] refactor: use explicit type annotations for TUpdateInputSche",
      "vars": {
        "pr_body": "## What does this PR do?\n\nRefactors `TUpdateInputSchema` in the tRPC event types package to use explicit TypeScript type annotations instead of relying on `z.infer<>` to compute types through complex schema chains. This is part of an effort to reduce TypeScript type-checking time, which was identified as the main performance bottleneck (20.5 seconds / 59% of total build time) in the tRPC package.\n\nThe key optimization is using `z.ZodType<T>` annotations on schemas, which tells TypeScript the type directly rather than having it infer through chains of `.extend()`, `.partial()`, `.merge()`, etc.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Define explicit TypeScript types for all nested structures (`HashedLinkInput`, `AiPhoneCallConfig`, `CalVideoSettings`, `HostInput`, `HostGroupInput`, `ChildInput`, `DestinationCalendarInput`, `RecurringEventInput`, `EventTypeColorInput`, `BookingFieldInput`, `RRSegmentQueryValueInput`)\n- Create comprehensive `TUpdateInputSchema` type with all ~80+ fields explicitly defined\n- Use `z.ZodType<TUpdateInputSchema>` annotation on `BaseEventTypeUpdateInput` schema\n- Remove dependency on `EventTypeSchema` from `@calcom/prisma/zod/modelSchema/` which was pulling in many generated types\n- Change from `.refine()` to `.superRefine()` for aiPhoneCallConfig transformations\n- Change `users` field type from `(string | number)[]` to `number[]` to match actual usage in handlers\n- Handle `bookingFields` null case in update handler by converting to `Prisma.DbNull` for JSON field compatibility\n\nRuntime validation behavior is preserved - only compile-time type inference is optimized.\n\n### Updates since last revision\n\n- **Fixed API v2 DTO compatibility**: Removed index signature `[key: string]: unknown` from `BookingFieldInput` type. The index signature was causing `BookingField_2024_04_15` (a NestJS DTO class) to be incompatible with `BookingFieldInput`. The index signature was unnecessary since `field.name` is used as an index key on `discoveredFields` (a `Record<string, true>`), not on the field object itself.\n\n- **Removed useless JSDoc comments**: Cleaned up redundant JSDoc comments on type definitions per PR feedback. Kept only the meaningful documentation on `BookingFieldInput` and `RRSegmentQueryValueInput` that explain important design decisions.\n\n- **Added unit tests for aiPhoneCallConfig transformation**: Added 8 unit tests in `types.test.ts` to verify the `.superRefine()` transformation behavior is equivalent to the original `.refine()` behavior. Tests cover default value handling for `yourPhoneNumber`, `numberToCall`, `guestName`, `guestEmail`, and `guestCompany` fields.\n\n## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)\n\n- [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).\n- [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). N/A - no documentation changes needed.\n- [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.\n\n## How should this be tested?\n\n1. Run `yarn type-check:ci --force` to verify TypeScript compilation passes\n2. Run `yarn lint` to verify linting passes\n3. Run `TZ=UTC yarn test packages/trpc/server/routers/viewer/eventTypes/__tests__/types.test.ts` to run the new unit tests\n4. Verify that event type update operations still work correctly in the application (the runtime validation should be unchanged)\n\nTo measure the performance improvement, compare tRPC build times before and after:\n```bash\ncd packages/trpc && time yarn build\n```\n\n\n## Human Review Checklist\n\n- [ ] Verify all fields from the original `EventTypeSchema` are present in `TUpdateInputSchema` with correct types\n- [ ] Check that nullability (`null`, `undefined`, optional) matches the original schema behavior\n- [ ] Verify the `superRefine` transformation is equivalent to the original `refine` behavior (unit tests now cover this)\n- [ ] Check if any consumers of `TUpdateInputSchema` break due to type cha"

      "vars": {
        "pr_body": "## What does this PR do?\n\nThis PR implements TypeScript project references for `@calcom/features` to prevent SDK types from leaking into dependent packages like `@calcom/trpc`. This is a follow-up to #26117 which applied a similar pattern to app-store services.\n\n### Problem\nWhen TypeScript compiles `@calcom/trpc`, it must resolve the entire Twilio SDK type graph (~555 .d.ts files) because `@calcom/features` exports functions that return Twilio SDK types. This significantly increases compilation time.\n\n### Solution\n1. **Local interface types**: Created `twilioProvider.types.ts` with minimal interfaces that only expose properties actually used by consumers\n2. **Explicit return types**: Added return type annotations to all 11 exported functions in `twilioProvider.ts`\n3. **TypeScript project references**: Added `tsconfig.build.json` and `typesVersions` configuration so that when types are pre-built, trpc consumes `.d.ts` files instead of typechecking source files\n\n### Results (when types are built)\n- Twilio SDK files in trpc compilation: **555 \u2192 0**\n- Total files in trpc compilation: **~7,735 \u2192 4,655 (40% reduction)**\n\n### Changes\n- Created `twilioProvider.types.ts` with local interface types\n- Added explicit return type annotations to all exported functions\n- Added `tsconfig.build.json` to build declaration files for `@calcom/features`\n- Added `typesVersions` to `@calcom/features/package.json` with fallback pattern\n- Added `typesVersions` to `@calcom/ee/package.json` to redirect to prebuilt types\n- Added `.gitignore` for generated types directory\n\nThe `typesVersions` fallback pattern allows the codebase to work without prebuilt types (falls back to source files), but when types are built ahead of time with `yarn build:types`, trpc consumes the `.d.ts` files instead.\n\n### Updates since last revision\n- Fixed `build:types` script to clean `types/` directory before building, preventing TS5055 \"Cannot write file because it would overwrite input file\" errors on repeated runs\n- Added explicit excludes for `**/*.d.ts` and `**/*.d.ts.map` in tsconfig.build.json\n\n### Known Issue\nRunning `yarn build:types` will show ~400+ pre-existing type errors in `packages/trpc` and `packages/prisma` (Prisma type mismatches). **These errors exist on main and are NOT caused by this PR.** TypeScript still emits the `.d.ts` files despite these errors, and the performance benefits are achieved.\n\n## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)\n\n- [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).\n- [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). N/A - no documentation changes needed.\n- [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works. N/A - this is a type-only change with no runtime behavior changes.\n\n## How should this be tested?\n\nThis is a TypeScript performance optimization with no runtime behavior changes. To verify:\n\n1. Build types: `cd packages/features && yarn build:types`\n2. Run `yarn tsc --project tsconfig.server.json --listFiles 2>/dev/null | grep \"node_modules/twilio\" | wc -l` in `packages/trpc` - should show 0 files\n3. Run `yarn tsc --project tsconfig.server.json --extendedDiagnostics` to compare compilation times\n4. Verify no type errors are introduced in consuming code\n\n## Human Review Checklist\n\n\n- [ ] Verify that consumers of `sendSMS`/`scheduleSMS` only use the `sid` property from the returned message response\n- [ ] Verify the `typesVersions` paths resolve correctly (especially `../features/types/ee/*` for `@calcom/ee`)\n- [ ] Verify CI/build pipeline will run `build:types` before trpc typecheck to get the performance benefits\n- [ ] Verify the fallback behavior (using source files when types aren't built) is acceptable for local development\n- [ ] Confirm the pre-existing Prisma type errors (~400+) shown during `build:types` are acceptable (they exist on main)\n\n## Checklist\n\n- ["

      "vars": {
        "pr_body": "## What does this PR do?\n\nThis PR reorganizes code to improve module boundaries and prevent circular dependencies:\n\n1. **Attribute repositories and services**: Moves `PrismaAttributeRepository`, `PrismaAttributeToUserRepository`, `PrismaAttributeOptionRepository`, and related attribute services from `packages/lib/server/repository/` and `packages/lib/service/attribute/server/` to `packages/features/attributes/`\n\n2. **Routing forms logic**: Moves `findTeamMembersMatchingAttributeLogic` and `handleResponse` from `packages/app-store/` to `packages/features/routing-forms/lib/`\n\n3. **Query resolution utilities**: Moves `resolveQueryValue.ts` from `packages/lib/raqb/` to `packages/app-store/routing-forms/lib/`\n\n### Why this change is needed\n\n- **Circular dependency prevention**: `app-store` should not import from `features`, but `features` can import from `app-store`. Moving routing-forms logic that depends on features code into `features` itself prevents circular dependencies.\n- **Better module boundaries**: Feature-specific repositories and services belong in `features/` where the related feature code resides, not in generic `lib/` directories.\n- This refactor is part of a larger effort to keep feature code self-contained within their specific directories in `features/`.\n\n### Type changes\n\nMoved and consolidated types to `packages/app-store/routing-forms/types/types.d.ts`:\n- `AttributeOptionValue` - represents attribute option with `isGroup`, `value`, and `contains` fields\n- `AttributeOptionValueWithType` - wraps `AttributeOptionValue` with `type` field\n- `AttributeOptionAssignment` - updated to explicitly define the `attribute` property structure with `id`, `type`, and `isLocked` fields\n- `AttributeName`, `AttributeId`, `BulkAttributeAssigner` - moved from deleted `packages/lib/service/attribute/types.d.ts`\n\n### Updates since last revision\n\nFixed build errors caused by the refactoring:\n- **AppPage.tsx / MultiDisconnectIntegration.tsx**: Changed from `inferRouterOutputs<AppRouter>` to `RouterOutputs` from `@calcom/trpc/react` for consistent type inference with tRPC hooks\n- **packages/lib/service/attribute/utils.ts**: Updated import path to point to the new types location at `@calcom/app-store/routing-forms/types/types`\n- **AttributeOptionAssignment type**: Explicitly defined the `attribute` property structure and removed unused `assignedUsers` from Pick to match actual data shape\n- Added eslint-disable comments for pre-existing warnings in AppPage.tsx\n\n## Human Review Checklist\n\n- [ ] Verify all import paths have been updated correctly (search for old paths like `@calcom/lib/server/repository/PrismaAttribute` or `@calcom/app-store/_utils/raqb/findTeamMembersMatchingAttributeLogic`)\n- [ ] Confirm the `AttributeOptionAssignment` type change doesn't break any consumers expecting the old structure (now explicitly defines `attribute: { id, type, isLocked }` instead of using Prisma's `Attribute` type)\n- [ ] Verify the `RouterOutputs` type change in AppPage.tsx/MultiDisconnectIntegration.tsx maintains correct type inference for credentials\n- [ ] Verify test mock paths are correctly updated in relocated test files\n\n## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)\n\n- [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).\n- [x] N/A - I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs).

      "vars": {
        "pr_body": "This PR fixes the `x-trigger-branch` header support for targeting specific preview branches when managing environment variables. The header was documented but not actually being extracted or used in the environment variable API routes. Additionally, the query logic in `authenticatedEnvironmentForAuthentication` was fundamentally broken\u2014it searched for environments with both `slug: \"preview\"` (parent environment property) AND a specific `branchName` (child environment property), which no environment could satisfy simultaneously. The fix extracts the branch name using `branchNameFromRequest()` and correctly queries for child branch environments using `type: \"PREVIEW\"` and the specific `branchName`. This ensures that environment variable operations (create, update, get, list) properly target individual preview branches instead of affecting all preview environments."

ClickHouse replication is **disabled by default** (`RUN_REPLICATION_ENABLED` not set)\r\n2. Without replication, ClickHouse tables remain **empty**\r\n3. Result: Dashboard shows **\"No runs found\"** even though runs exist in PostgreSQL \u274c\r\n\r\n\r\n## \u2705 Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have followed every step in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [X] The PR title follows the convention.\r\n- [X] I ran and tested the code works\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### \u2705 Bug Fixed in Local Development\r\n1. Followed `CONTRIBUTING.md` setup (without `RUN_REPLICATION_ENABLED=1`)\r\n2. Started services with `pnpm run docker`\r\n3. Started webapp with `pnpm run dev --filter webapp`\r\n4. Triggered a task run\r\n5. **Result:** \u2705 Runs now appear on the dashboard (was showing \"No runs found\" before)\r\n\r\n### \u2705 Production Behavior Unchanged\r\n1. Set `RUN_REPLICATION_ENABLED=1` and `RUN_REPLICATION_CLICKHOUSE_URL`\r\n2. Triggered a task run\r\n3. **Result:** \u2705 Still uses ClickHouse, performance unchanged\r\n\r\n### \u2705 No Lint Errors\r\n- All files pass TypeScript checks\r\n- No new linter warnings introduced\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcaf\r\n"

        "pr_body": "Fixes #1058 \r\n\r\n# Update chat auth to allow anonymous sessions with matching sessionId\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nUpdated authentication logic across chat endpoints to use OR instead of AND logic. Previously, anonymous sessions were blocked from accessing conversations that had an `emailFrom` set. Now, access is granted if either:\r\n- The session has a matching `anonymousSessionId` (for anonymous sessions)\r\n- The session has a matching email address (for authenticated sessions)\r\n\r\nThis change affects 3 endpoints:\r\n- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Main chat endpoint\r\n- `app/api/chat/conversation/[slug]/message/[id]/route.ts` - Message reactions\r\n- `app/api/chat/conversation/[slug]/message/[id]/event/route.ts` - Message events\r\n\r\nThe new logic follows the same pattern already used in `app/api/chat/customerFilter.ts`.\r\n\r\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\r\n- [ ] **Security review**: Verify the OR logic doesn't grant unintended access to conversations\r\n- [ ] **End-to-end testing**: Test with both anonymous and authenticated sessions to ensure proper access control\r\n- [ ] **Edge case testing**: Test scenarios with missing `anonymousSessionId` or `emailFrom` values\r\n- [ ] **Requirements alignment**: Confirm the change matches the original request to allow anonymous sessions with correct sessionId\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThis is a critical authentication change that should be thoroughly tested before deployment. The logic change allows anonymous users to continue accessing conversations even after they provide their email address, as long as they have the correct `anonymousSessionId`.\r\n\r\nLink to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/686cb024beba4e4682568ce9c307835c\r\nRequested by: reason.koan@gmail.com"
